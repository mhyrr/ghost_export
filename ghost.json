After College","slug":"learning_after_college","markdown":"I am now over five years out from college.  Five years seems to hold no particular substance beyond any other measure, aside from being used by industry as a benchmark for someone that now has a little bit of experience under their belt.  (This, I'm quite sure, is an arbitrary measurement linked to some facile business practice developed by someone who found the number of fingers on his hand fascinating.)  I do feel more experienced than I did when I left college.  Perhaps I feel more aware - I have a very Confucian feeling of my ignorance.  When I left college, I had a very large head planted firmly on my shoulders.  I had an engineering degree, which is no small feat compared to other degrees, and that degree commanded a salary beyond most college hires.  It seems inevitable that some form of arrogance will result.  It was a foolish arrogance though, based squarely in not knowing (and not wanting to know).\n\n### UML is teh winnar!!11!1\n\nMy first job out of college, they wanted to train me on RationalRose configuration management and ClearCase.  They had <em>teams</em> dedicated to making sure these things worked right.  If you don't know, really caring about ClearCase is the same as caring more about requirements and maturity processes than actual algorithm development or any other truly computer science based topic.\n\nThe question of what computer science actually is - especially vs. software engineering - is, of course, an open question covered frequently in lots of other places, so I won't go there.  Suffice to say, a newly graduated computer science or computer engineering student does not dream of a job in configuration management.  They dream of meaty, substantial problems about logic, graph traversals, language paradigms, or whatever else.  Taking all that ambition and throwing it at superficial, mindless problems - which is the typical track for big businesses, pay your dues and the like - is a death knell to your creativity and desire for growth.\n\nThat's exactly what happened too.  I got the very distinct impression after college that software development was crap.  Yes, it paid well, and yes, it had a lot of flexibility.  But the job itself, the meat, was just not that interesting.  All that interesting stuff from college was saved exclusively for the academic realm.  I stopped caring, and I focused on other academic pursuits.  I did a lot of reading, in a breadth-first fashion, to cover the topics I always found interesting but never pursued.  None of it was about computer science.  I regret this greatly now, but I'll get to that shortly.\n\nAfter my brief near-death exposure to RationalRose and ClearCase, I moved on to Gantt Charts.  A real big move upwards, I can tell you.  I continued along with that (and my modest 2 weeks of vacation) for about 6 months before looking harder.  When I switched to a far better company, it came with a nice bonus: better work.  My next set of projects had a much more researchy bent, and *gasp* actually involved programming!  Amazing.  Merely eighteen months after graduating, I might actually be asked to write some code.  I was rusty.  Really rusty.  (Hell, I'm still rusty).  And wouldn't you know it?  I still didn't like what I was doing.  [Boyer-Moore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_string_search_algorithm) and [Aho-Corasick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho-Corasick_algorithm) are really neat string searching algorithms, but over the next three years I finally discovered what *really* matters to enjoy your work.  Your environment.\n\n### People People\n\nFor the first four years out of college, I really didn't like the people I worked with.  There were one or two people I enjoyed working with, but I didn't engage with them on an everyday basis.  I didn't like the physical environment either.  My single 17\" CRT monitor in the corner of my cubicle just wasn't the paragon of high technology I hoped to use.\n\nThis is a curious realization for an introvert.  Most of my days, I'm quite happy talking minimally during work (which, I think, is common for computer-related fields).  So based on raw quantity of exposure, the pleasure I derive from these relationships should not matter.  That's just not how it turns out.  I switched jobs again about a year ago, and the dynamism of that change still boggles my mind.  I really, really owe the person who helped me make the switch.\n\nThe people I work with now all share a common set of factors that have completely changed the way I look at this entire field.  They're all smart, they're excited to learn more, they're insatiable about it and about getting things right, and they're very laid back.  Through the people I work with, I'm rekindling a love for computer science, math, and figuring shit out.  It's like college all over again, and it makes me think a lot about my college years.\n\n### Efficiency Models and Their Applications\n\nI liked computers in high school, and I seemed to have a certain ability with them.  I liked math more and always figured a job in the hard sciences was in my future.  When I decided on a college, I picked Computer Engineering based on difficulty rather than interest.  I never really hooked up with a crew in my major that was into the field.  Instead of learning efficiency algorithms in the classroom, we had a real world algorithm that mattered more: we wanted to spend the least amount of time possible to get by.

computer engineers had to do hardware too - but getting some more of the basics down would have been better.  It ain't all my fault either.  I'd never heard of functional programming or design patterns in school and, as far as I know, it wasn't even taught where I went.  But dammit I'm gonna make up for lost time.\n\n### Grad school\n\nI bet it sounds like I ought to be in grad school.  I've been waffling about that a bit, and I'm not so sure.  Masters degrees often seem purely devoted to career advancement, which often means program management and other slightly less technical paths.  A doctorate is a remarkable piece of academic discipline and commitment with, let's face it, very, very little pay.\n\nThere's a third path, and it depends a lot on the people around you.  When you get wrapped up in a group of people dedicated and focused on learning more in a field, it almost feels like college again, and you have a study group.  There are none of the tradeoffs in your life that graduate school can require, since it's on your own time and you can move with it as it pleases you.  And if the interest is there, the rigor in the subject should follow.  I may not have the formalism of tests and projects with deadlines, but my day job satisfies that property, and I have the freedom to choose between a breadth-first or depth-first approach.\n\nSo if you find yourself out of college and thinking that the right thing to do now is grad school, take some time to weigh your options a bit.  It's entirely possible to keep learning without school, and the subset of people that might consider grad school will probably also be the best at going their own way.  Still, it's important to have some guidelines on what you should do to keep learning.  Here's a crack at it:\n\n*\tReading\n*\tWriting\n*\t'Rithmetic\n*\tDoing shit\n*\tRecess\n\nHey, this is easy, it's like 3rd grade again.\n\n### Reading\nI've always been a reader, since at least elementary school.  As I said somewhere near the beginning of this diatribe, the amount of reading I do was compounded after graduation.  The topics were, in some ways, irrelevant.  I read to fill in blank places where knowledge didn't exist.  Sometimes it was broad, sometimes it was deep.  Sometimes novels or poetry.  Sometimes physics or history.  The important thing was (and is) to keep doing it.  The amount of information from different perspectives you accumulate starts to really circulate in your head.  It makes you think.  It makes you meta-think.  Reading is the primary fundamental thing that makes you think more and better.  I know very, very few people that I consider extremely intelligent that DON'T read - and it still makes me go cross-eyed at how that can be.\n\n### Writing\n\nThis one is hard for me.  It's one of the reasons for this tiny little corner of the Intarwebs.  I really suck at it, and I want to get better.  If reading makes you think, writing makes you able to articulate what you think.  Everyone has [beautiful, dangerous pictures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractatus_Logico_Philosophicus) swirling around their head.  Wouldn't it be scary if you were actually able to make them cogent to others?  That's what writing does, and it's hugely important to practice.  Unlike reading, however, it requires a different type of investment, one that makes you feel extremely humble.  Reading a book allows you to climb up to the plateau at which the author's level of articulation allows.  But trying to write to that plateau is like free climbing with a blindfold.  There are [habits](http://www.dumblittleman.com/2008/03/9-ways-to-jumpstart-your-writing-goal.html) that can help tremendously, but it still takes monumental effort.  Articulation is an incredibly precise art, and so I fear my great thoughts.\n\n### 'Rithmetic\n\nMath is another exercise for the mind.  Somewhere recently I read it described as weightlifting for your brain.  The reason why math is so important, even to people that don't care about science, is that it helps you think in levels of abstraction.  Unfortunately, a lot of math taught in schools boils down to plugging numbers into memorized formulas.  It's really a sad state, but that subject is for another time.  If you hated math during school, coming back to it now may be more interesting than you expect, especially with a well written book to get you started.  Steve Yegge had a great blurb on [Math for Programmers](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/math-for-programmers.html), which turns out not to be just for programmers.  Go read that, he's way better at my second point than me.\n\n### Doing Shit\n\nThis is part of the first three, but it's also something else.  It's not sufficient to read for a half hour on Saturday morning.  It's not enough to write in your diary for 15 minutes every other week.  \"Doing\" is an active verb.  You've got to be relentless about it.  You have to be insatiable.  Clearly, you really have to want to do it.  You've then got to take those skills to whatever real field you want to learn and apply it.  I read for at least an hour everyday.  This takes various forms: articles, blogs, academic papers, novels, books, etc.  I try to write as often as I can, but that's hard.  I keep up on math, and various bits of theory or interesting wikipedia articles regularly.  (You wouldn't believe how good a resource Wikipedia is for math.)  But I also go to my specific field, computer science, and do whatever theory/programming I can on my own.  Lately that means Ruby.  The joy of learning a new language filled with buttery goodness adds more fuel to the fire.  Yes, I really said buttery goodness.  Ruby's that cool.\n\n### Recess\nThis was not on my original list, but it's an important point.  Being relentless with something like this does not translate to tedium.  If the process seems like a never ending chore, you'll wind up beating your head against the wall.  It's important to take breaks, to maintain a Joie de Vivre.  Even in a professional application, I wouldn't want to [work with workaholics](http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/902-fire-the-workaholics).\n\n### Coda\nThat's it, that's what it takes to keep learning.  Come to think of it, this formula is really in parallel to school, rather than in series.  You can do these things at any point in your life, and wherever you are, it will make you think more and better.\n\t\tListen to what I shall call Him: the Bottomless Abyss, the Insatiable, the Merciless, the Indefatigable, the Unsatisfied.

I have a very Confucian feeling of my ignorance.  When I left college, I had a very large head planted firmly on my shoulders.  I had an engineering degree, which is no small feat compared to other degrees, and that degree commanded a salary beyond most college hires.  It seems inevitable that some form of arrogance will result.  It was a foolish arrogance though, based squarely in not knowing (and not wanting to know).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"umlistehwinnar111\">UML is teh winnar!!11!1</h3>\n\n<p>My first job out of college, they wanted to train me on RationalRose configuration management and ClearCase.  They had <em>teams</em> dedicated to making sure these things worked right.  If you don't know, really caring about ClearCase is the same as caring more about requirements and maturity processes than actual algorithm development or any other truly computer science based topic.</p>\n\n<p>The question of what computer science actually is - especially vs. software engineering - is, of course, an open question covered frequently in lots of other places, so I won't go there.  Suffice to say, a newly graduated computer science or computer engineering student does not dream of a job in configuration management.  They dream of meaty, substantial problems about logic, graph traversals, language paradigms, or whatever else.  Taking all that ambition and throwing it at superficial, mindless problems - which is the typical track for big businesses, pay your dues and the like - is a death knell to your creativity and desire for growth.</p>\n\n<p>That's exactly what happened too.  I got the very distinct impression after college that software development was crap.  Yes, it paid well, and yes, it had a lot of flexibility.  But the job itself, the meat, was just not that interesting.  All that interesting stuff from college was saved exclusively for the academic realm.  I stopped caring, and I focused on other academic pursuits.  I did a lot of reading, in a breadth-first fashion, to cover the topics I always found interesting but never pursued.  None of it was about computer science.  I regret this greatly now, but I'll get to that shortly.</p>\n\n<p>After my brief near-death exposure to RationalRose and ClearCase, I moved on to Gantt Charts.  A real big move upwards, I can tell you.  I continued along with that (and my modest 2 weeks of vacation) for about 6 months before looking harder.  When I switched to a far better company, it came with a nice bonus: better work.  My next set of projects had a much more researchy bent, and <em>gasp</em> actually involved programming!  Amazing.  Merely eighteen months after graduating, I might actually be asked to write some code.  I was rusty.  Really rusty.  (Hell, I'm still rusty).  And wouldn't you know it?  I still didn't like what I was doing.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_string_search_algorithm\">Boyer-Moore</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho-Corasick_algorithm\">Aho-Corasick</a> are really neat string searching algorithms, but over the next three years I finally discovered what <em>really</em> matters to enjoy your work.  Your environment.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"peoplepeople\">People People</h3>\n\n<p>For the first four years out of college, I really didn't like the people I worked with.  There were one or two people I enjoyed working with, but I didn't engage with them on an everyday basis.  I didn't like the physical environment either.  My single 17\" CRT monitor in the corner of my cubicle just wasn't the paragon of high technology I hoped to use.</p>\n\n<p>This is a curious realization for an introvert.  Most of my days, I'm quite happy talking minimally during work (which, I think, is common for computer-related fields).  So based on raw quantity of exposure, the pleasure I derive from these relationships should not matter.  That's just not how it turns out.  I switched jobs again about a year ago, and the dynamism of that change still boggles my mind.  I really, really owe the person who helped me make the switch.</p>\n\n<p>The people I work with now all share a common set of factors that have completely changed the way I look at this entire field.  They're all smart, they're excited to learn more, they're insatiable about it and about getting things right, and they're very laid back.  Through the people I work with, I'm rekindling a love for computer science, math, and figuring shit out.  It's like college all over again, and it makes me think a lot about my college years.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"efficiencymodelsandtheirapplications\">Efficiency Models and Their Applications</h3>\n\n<p>I liked computers in high school, and I seemed to have a certain ability with them.  I liked math more and always figured a job in the hard sciences was in my future.  When I decided on a college, I picked Computer Engineering based on difficulty rather than interest.  I never really hooked up with a crew in my major that was into the field.  Instead of learning efficiency algorithms in the classroom, we had a real world algorithm that mattered more: we wanted to spend the least amount of time possible to get by. (Caveat: Getting by had a varying definition, but usually meant a 3.3-3.5 GPA depending on scholarships, honors, etc.. so we weren't total slackers.)  That was our idea of an efficiency model, and we applied it as well as we could.  Psych 101 meant getting the syllabus and taking two exams during the semester.  Studying for transistor logic meant a night spent cramming instead of good note taking and regular study habits.  Skipping class was an extracurricular activity, the books just weren't all that special, and neither were the projects.  It was always just something you had to do, staccato'd with the occasional epiphany.  I still remember staring at a whiteboard for a solid half hour bewildered after a few of us arranged 16 boolean operators into a hypercube based on their associations.  If only it had application.</p>\n\n<p>That whole application thing got in the way a lot.  Academia today is often looked at as a sort of trade school for different fields, and especially for engineers.  (Not including the psychology, sociology, history and english majors which are all a basis for, depending on your point of view; everything, graduate school, or unemployment.)  So when you're learning your craft, the theory of it doesn't seem particularly interesting.  It's never proposed as the foundational element; the building block.  It's just crap you have to do.  It's ironic that in the workplace many people consider research or theory to be the holy grail.  Usually it means you're developing new applications and charting new territory.  It's glamorous.</p>\n\n<p>Were I to do it all over again, I'd study more.  A lot more.

Work Happens in Dark Rooms","slug":"real_work_happens_in_dark_rooms","markdown":"Sometime when I was young, my family got dimmer switches in our family room.  I used to make it my goal in the evening to set the switch to the lowest possible setting that would still emit light from the bulbs.  It was fun to see just how little light could illuminate objects across the room.\n\nIn bed at night, I often kept a flashlight with me, so that I could read surreptitiously under the covers past bedtime.  Naturally, I used the flashlight to illuminate as little as possible in my bedroom too.  I had an alarm clock with a bright red digital display.  The less light was visible, the larger the contrast between the red display and the rest of the room.  The red seemed to burn into my brain.  But turn the lights on, and it didn't seem very bright.  So I tried keeping the flashlight under the covers and rotating it in an arc to linearly grade the amount of light that went into the room.  The more light that escaped into the room, the more color was available.  I could get so little light out that it seemed like everything, even though I could still see it, was in shades of gray.  This was before I learned the ROYGBIV mnemonic for the visible light spectrum, but I started to get pretty interested in light and quickly learned of it.  It seemed like a discovery at the time, albeit only a personal one.  Looking back now it seems obvious.\n\nI prefer greatly working in quasi or complete darkness.  I thought this was simply an artifact of early experiences, mostly of reading in the dark.  Lately I've been wondering if I like working in the dark because it's the natural state of intellectual work.\n\nI suppose that's the first point of clarification.  \"Real work\" should be defined as anything that requires some level of intellectual processing power.  Perhaps a better description would be \"creative work\" happens in dark rooms, which doesn't encompass all types of work.  For instance, there certainly is very real work that occurs outside.  This is, in the general case, a different sort of brain function.  When I'm laying on the driveway underneath a car, I'm not working out the location of parts of the vehicle for ideal polar moments given a certain mass and wheelbase.  I'm working to get the predefined correct amount of camber, or making sure a spring is aligned properly.  I'm focused much more on the concrete rather than the abstract.  \"Real work\" of the type I mean can be roughly defined by the level of abstraction required.  Here's a non-exhaustive list:\n\n*\tCreative Arts\n*\tAcademic and Humanities Research\n*\tMath (real math, this does not mean repetitive exercises)\n*\tWriting\n*\tEngineering Design\n*\tSoftware Development\n\nWe're specifically considering any task that requires a certain level of abstraction and creativity, something that requires intensive focus or concentration.  Does this have to happen in the dark?  No, it doesn't have to, but if it doesn't, it's severely hampered.  Consider the image that comes to mind when you think of a scholar pouring over a book in a library, a writer attempting to capture thoughts in book form, or even a hacker furiously typing at a keyboard.\n\n<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Michelangelo_Caravaggio_057.jpg/300px-Michelangelo_Caravaggio_057.jpg\" alt=\"St. Jerome Writing (from Wikipedia\" height=\"216\" width=\"300\" />\n\nMost people typically think of these sorts of activities occurring in darkness, with a swaddling pool of light surrounding the object of interest and the interested.  This image comes immediately to most of us, but it generally goes unnoticed.  Artists noticed it, naturally, and depictions of those in study are often surrounded by darkness.\n\nIt turns out that the very focus and demand for concentration that cerebral tasks require is the impetus for operating in a dark environment.  Humans are incredibly sensual.  When our senses are aroused to action, our capacity for focus on anything else decreases rapidly.  A friend of mine can do a fair bit of carpentry, which I've helped with at various times.  If I ask him the simplest question while he's doing something with his hands, he doesn't even hear me.  I have to yell to get his attention, and then I have to make sure he's looking at me so he'll hear the question.\n\nThe greatest of our sensual reliance comes from our vision.  One of the reasons mountain vistas are so breathtaking is the simple amount of space that registers - our brains need time to compute and understand it.  Conversely, when our vision is somehow limited, the world beyond, almost literally to our brains, ceases to exist.  It's much easier to focus on what's within our world if there's less of it.  Our brains can only hold a certain space at any one time - we can sometimes do somersaults with a small problem space - but the entire mountain vista will take a long time to really grasp.  The easiest way to limit ourselves to one exclusive space is darkness.\n\n<img src=\"http://riskman.smugmug.com/photos/247422664_tx9fT-M.jpg\" alt=\"Lago di Como, Italia\" height=\"400\" width=\"600\" />\n\nIt's interesting to note that there's a difference between limiting the world with darkness and limiting it with physical boundaries.  In civic design, there's the idea of an active and permeable membrane for public spaces.  The idea is that a public space has edges that are well defined, but that objects (people, goods, waiters from a restaurant, etc.) can go in and out easily.  Imagine a public square rimmed with bakeries, shops, restaurants, and churches.  (Incidentally, it's not really possible to understand this ideal without visiting Europe.)  This is what makes the public space feel alive.  In the same way, defining a small space for our world will result in a small set of ideas that can't grow.  But in darkness, it's possible to bring objects (pens, pencils, paper, books, ideas) in and out as necessary.\n\nWhat darkness actually provides is a consistent, comfortable, and confident environment to attack a scary, difficult problem.  It enhances one's level of mental acuity by allowing the rest of the world to, quite literally, melt away.\n\nThis isn't to say that it's the only way to work.  Everyone needs daylight, preferably a lot of it, and especially in contrast to darkness.  In fact, like sleep, a daylight break will often allow fairly startling revelations to pop out.  It's also the easiest place to collaborate.  People tend to be more forthright and communicative in natural light than they are in darkness or artificial light.  It's no wonder that the brilliant tech companies out there have huge window filled lounges with ping-pong, pool tables, and couches for their employees to hang out in.  These types of environments actually enhance the level of work being performed.\n\nSo why is turning the lights off in most office spaces a corporate faux pas?  Most jobs, quite frankly, don't take a great deal of mental heavy lifting (employers often like to think they do).  If that heavy concentration is required, it's generally tackled off hours, either before or after the normal workday, with minimal distractions.  It always seems like the people that really get a lot done either get in early and leave early or get in late and leave late.  The typical 9-5er's, often, simply take up space. \\*\n\n<img src=\"http://www.ehow.com/images/GlobalPhoto/Articles/2027336/office-space-06_Full.jpg\" alt=\"Office Space\" height=\"400\" width=\"600\" />\n\nThe real problem exists when a job commonly calls for this sort of real work and the corporate culture doesn't exist for it.  Software development generally remains disregarded as a creative art, and so managers gloss over these sorts of creative positions.  This is bad news for developers.  But think about it - by providing florescent lights that hum lightly, a manager (or company) is really asking a developer only for status updates, requirements, and metrics, rather than any sort of creative effort.  Sometimes, that may be the point.  It's less risky, creative works have far higher standards than maintaining the status quo.\n\nSo the next time you encounter something you want to put some real mental effort towards, try turning off the lights.\n\n\\* This is just a general rule, and definitely does not apply in a good environment.\n","html":"<p>Sometime when I was young, my family got dimmer switches in our family room.  I used to make it my goal in the evening to set the switch to the lowest possible setting that would still emit light from the bulbs.  It was fun to see just how little light could illuminate objects across the room.</p>\n\n<p>In bed at night, I often kept a flashlight with me, so that I could read surreptitiously under the covers past bedtime.  Naturally, I used the flashlight to illuminate as little as possible in my bedroom too.  I had an alarm clock with a bright red digital display.  The less light was visible, the larger the contrast between the red display and the rest of the room.  The red seemed to burn into my brain.  But turn the lights on, and it didn't seem very bright.  So I tried keeping the flashlight under the covers and rotating it in an arc to linearly grade the amount of light that went into the room.  The more light that escaped into the room, the more color was available.  I could get so little light out that it seemed like everything, even though I could still see it, was in shades of gray.  This was before I learned the ROYGBIV mnemonic for the visible light spectrum, but I started to get pretty interested in light and quickly learned of it.  It seemed like a discovery at the time, albeit only a personal one.  Looking back now it seems obvious.</p>\n\n<p>I prefer greatly working in quasi or complete darkness.  I thought this was simply an artifact of early experiences, mostly of reading in the dark.  Lately I've been wondering if I like working in the dark because it's the natural state of intellectual work.</p>\n\n<p>I suppose that's the first point of clarification.  \"Real work\" should be defined as anything that requires some level of intellectual processing power.  Perhaps a better description would be \"creative work\" happens in dark rooms, which doesn't encompass all types of work.  For instance, there certainly is very real work that occurs outside.  This is, in the general case, a different sort of brain function.  When I'm laying on the driveway underneath a car, I'm not working out the location of parts of the vehicle for ideal polar moments given a certain mass and wheelbase.  I'm working to get the predefined correct amount of camber, or making sure a spring is aligned properly.  I'm focused much more on the concrete rather than the abstract.  \"Real work\" of the type I mean can be roughly defined by the level of abstraction required.  Here's a non-exhaustive list:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Creative Arts</li>\n<li>Academic and Humanities Research</li>\n<li>Math (real math, this does not mean repetitive exercises)</li>\n<li>Writing</li>\n<li>Engineering Design</li>\n<li>Software Development</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We're specifically considering any task that requires a certain level of abstraction and creativity, something that requires intensive focus or concentration.  Does this have to happen in the dark?  No, it doesn't have to, but if it doesn't, it's severely hampered.  Consider the image that comes to mind when you think of a scholar pouring over a book in a library, a writer attempting to capture thoughts in book form, or even a hacker furiously typing at a keyboard.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Michelangelo_Caravaggio_057.jpg/300px-Michelangelo_Caravaggio_057.jpg\" alt=\"St. Jerome Writing (from Wikipedia\" height=\"216\" width=\"300\" /></p>\n\n<p>Most people typically think of these sorts of activities occurring in darkness, with a swaddling pool of light surrounding the object of interest and the interested.  This image comes immediately to most of us, but it generally goes unnoticed.  Artists noticed it, naturally, and depictions of those in study are often surrounded by darkness.</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that the very focus and demand for concentration that cerebral tasks require is the impetus for operating in a dark environment.  Humans are incredibly sensual.  When our senses are aroused to action, our capacity for focus on anything else decreases rapidly.  A friend of mine can do a fair bit of carpentry, which I've helped with at various times.  If I ask him the simplest question while he's doing something with his hands, he doesn't even hear me.  I have to yell to get his attention, and then I have to make sure he's looking at me so he'll hear the question.</p>\n\n<p>The greatest of our sensual reliance comes from our vision.  One of the reasons mountain vistas are so breathtaking is the simple amount of space that registers - our brains need time to compute and understand it.  Conversely, when our vision is somehow limited, the world beyond, almost literally to our brains, ceases to exist.  It's much easier to focus on what's within our world if there's less of it.  Our brains can only hold a certain space at any one time - we can sometimes do somersaults with a small problem space - but the entire mountain vista will take a long time to really grasp.  The easiest way to limit ourselves to one exclusive space is darkness.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://riskman.smugmug.com/photos/247422664_tx9fT-M.jpg\" alt=\"Lago di Como, Italia\" height=\"400\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n\n<p>It's interesting to note that there's a difference between limiting the world with darkness and limiting it with physical boundaries.  In civic design, there's the idea of an active and permeable membrane for public spaces.  The idea is that a public space has edges that are well defined, but that objects (people, goods, waiters from a restaurant, etc.) can go in and out easily.  Imagine a public square rimmed with bakeries, shops, restaurants, and churches.  (Incidentally, it's not really possible to understand this ideal without visiting Europe.)  This is what makes the public space feel alive.  In the same way, defining a small space for our world will result in a small set of ideas that can't grow.  But in darkness, it's possible to bring objects (pens, pencils, paper, books, ideas) in and out as necessary.</p>\n\n<p>What darkness actually provides is a consistent, comfortable, and confident environment to attack a scary, difficult problem.  It enhances one's level of mental acuity by allowing the rest of the world to, quite literally, melt away.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't to say that it's the only way to work.  Everyone needs daylight, preferably a lot of it, and especially in contrast to darkness.  In fact, like sleep, a daylight break will often allow fairly startling revelations to pop out.  It's also the easiest place to collaborate.  People tend to be more forthright and communicative in natural light than they are in darkness or artificial light.  It's no wonder that the brilliant tech companies out there have huge window filled lounges with ping-pong, pool tables, and couches for their employees to hang out in.  These types of environments actually enhance the level of work being performed.</p>\n\n<p>So why is turning the lights off in most office spaces a corporate faux pas?  Most jobs, quite frankly, don't take a great deal of mental heavy lifting (employers often like to think they do).  If that heavy concentration is required, it's generally tackled off hours, either before or after the normal workday, with minimal distractions.  It always seems like the people that really get a lot done either get in early and leave early or get in late and leave late.  The typical 9-5er's, often, simply take up space. *</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.ehow.com/images/GlobalPhoto/Articles/2027336/office-space-06_Full.jpg\" alt=\"Office Space\" height=\"400\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n\n<p>The real problem exists when a job commonly calls for this sort of real work and the corporate culture doesn't exist for it.  Software development generally remains disregarded as a creative art, and so managers gloss over these sorts of creative positions.  This is bad news for developers.  But think about it - by providing florescent lights that hum lightly, a manager (or company) is really asking a developer only for status updates, requirements, and metrics, rather than any sort of creative effort.  Sometimes, that may be the point.  It's less risky, creative works have far higher standards than maintaining the status quo.</p>\n\n<p>So the next time you encounter something you want to put some real mental effort towards, try turning off the lights.</p>\n\n<p>* This is just a general rule, and definitely does not apply in a good

basic premise goes like this: you get to choose 1 of 3 doors.  1 of the 3 doors has a new car behind it, the other 2 have goats.  After you've made your choice, Monty Hall shows you a goat behind one of the doors, and asks if you'd like to switch doors to the other remaining unopened door.  Is there a statistical difference between your two choices?  (For a precise definition, see the [Wikipedia

difference, as the myriad proofs on Wikipedia show.  But it's just a weird answer.  Our gut tells us you've got a 50/50 shot either way.\n\nA while back, I argued with a friend about this for awhile.

Davies\n\t\t\nOriginally, I guess this seemed like a great goal.  If we could cram in as much as possible we could get more done and know more stuff.  It never works out that way though.  When you do 3 things at once, you give them each 33% of your attention, not 100% of it.  The information equivalent is trading knowledge for raw data.  What good is the data?  Does it really matter if you can't extract knowledge?  The world very clearly answers no in a lot of cases.  But dear God, look at what cultures can do by focusing on perfecting something exclusively.  Read up on the intricacy and beauty of the [Japanese Tea Ceremony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_tea_ceremony) for instance, or [Calligraphy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calligraphy), or even.. [Donald Knuth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_knuth).\n\nYes, yes I know, strange tact (that is, if you know who Donald Knuth is).  But really, Knuth is the developer of the Japanese Tea Ceremony while all the rest of us just drink Lipton.  We drink a lot of tea, but we haven't figured out the economies of motion that produce grace, and we never even intuit a deeper meaning to what we're doing.  Knuth paused an entire lifetime, and devoted it to the perfection of a brand new art, computer programming.  And isn't it a wonder that his books are the ultimate resource for the fundamentals of the entire field.  Want to really learn Computer Science?  Fine, go grab [TAOCP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming) and spend [10 years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html) with them.\n\nIn fact, Knuth is one of the most fascinating anachronisms in all of culture right now.  He's built or recorded the fundamentals of an entire field known for subverting people's attention and producing short attention spans (and employing people with the same) through an unbelievable discipline and single-minded devotion.\n\nOk, I really didn't want to go off on a tangent about anything remotely related to computer science.  What I was really thinking about was the effort it takes to do something, and to do it well.  To understand any task takes a certain amount of time, devotion, and effort.  But that understanding does wonderful things to your well being.  It's relaxing and comforting and does an amazing job at keeping you sane.  It provides reason and meaning.\n\nAnd lo! most of the things that are crucially important to keeping us (or at least me) sane and allowing us to pause are things we already do, but don't really take notice of.  So I've tried to compile a brief list of some things that ought to be done exclusively sometimes.  They shouldn't be multitasked, and they shouldn't be shunted aside.  When done by themselves, they allow us to unwind.  To think deeply rather than go scatterbrained.  They increase our quality of life.\n\n### Listen to music\n\nThere's an important distinction between background noise and foreground sound.  Most of our listening now is completely secondary to other tasks, usually driving, working or dining.  I'm listening to music as I write this.  Even listening to an iPod while walking places the music secondary to some more essential task.\n\nEvery once in awhile I put in a CD, turn off the lights, and just sit and listen.  Real music and real listening.   It's wonderfully refreshing to actually allow oneself to be carried away by the performance.  Music can evoke a journey and an emotion better than almost anything else in this world.  Of course, this paragraph would be useless without a shameless plug for some of my own musical selections: Rachmaninoff (Vespers, Piano Concerto No. 2), Paganini, Bach (Chaconne from Partita No. 2 stands alone in music to me), Alkan's Four Ages of Man, Jeff Buckley, Johnny Cash, Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Tom Waits, and others.\n\n### Drive a car\n\nThis one might be specific to me, I'm not sure.  Especially on a nice day, one of my favorite things to do is hop in my car and blast.  I drive all the time, but usually it's to and from work, or in traffic, or when I'm in a hurry.  But cruising down a country lane with the windows down is one of the most freeing, relaxing feelings I've encountered.  It's a very physical manifestation of leaving your troubles in your wake.  It's for those moments that people actually care about the car they drive.\n\n### Drink wine\n\nI know a lot of people who drink wine.  I know very few who really pause to understand what they drink.  People are generally scared of what they don't understand yet, and like to cover their fear with disinterest.  But understanding doesn't have to begin with knowledge of varietals in their region.  In fact, that's usually the last thing that happens.  No, the first thing that happens is when someone decides to stick their nose into a glass and pay attention.   Then, usually by luck or recommendation, they might actually find something beyond grape juice.  Is it fruit, earth, or something else?  Whatever that first true experience provides, it's intriguing.\n\nDrinking a good bottle of wine, all by itself, is a love affair complete with all the acts, from anticipation to fond memory.  It makes you think clearly about the world.  It's been said of a particularly stunning wine, Chateau d'Yquem Sauternes, that \"Yquem is, it seems, history, poetry, perhaps life itself rolled into a  wine and bottled\".  The movie [Sideways](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375063/) is a wonderful exposition of the wine experience.\n\n### Eat\n\nLast weekend I went to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse with two friends from work.  It was my first time there.  It was fabulous.  Before the food was brought out, there was some conversation, and there was more over a cigar later.  But during the meal there was very nearly silence.  All of us were far too busy savoring the meal.  This sounds rude or uncomfortable at first, but it was a communal choice, and we shared a wonderful meal.  The focus was the food.\n\nThe best meal I ever had was in Italy, at [Hostaria L'angolo Del Beato](http://www.hostarialangolodelbeato.it/hostaria.asp), and it was a lot of courses.  There was extremely enjoyable conversation, but again there was focus on the food and the experience.  When it all comes together - great companionship, great food, great atmosphere - it's a remarkable experience.\n\n### Write to someone you love\n\nJust as we seem to have traded knowledge for raw data, we also seem to have traded substantial correspondence for email.  This downward trend will just continue further with IM, social networking, and Twitter.  Sometimes though, things *ought* to be said that *can't* be said in simple little sound bytes and one liners.  It can be dramatically useful, not only for the recipient but also for the writer, to express deeper workings of the mind on paper.  The more I write, the more I realize how tied my thoughts are to my words.  Why not share them with someone close to you?\n\nThis can be a practical matter too.   In many cases, a lot of what we know of historical figures can be found in their correspondence with others.  Do you think your great grandchildren will read your old emails?  Do you want them to know who you are?\n\n### Read a book\n\nFunny how often reading has come up so far on here.  I knew I thought reading was important, but this is getting ridiculous.\n\nReading is one of my very favorite activities.  Specifically novels.  I do a lot of reading every day, I make sure to, but I rarely set aside time for it.  Most of it is accomplished on the run, or in between other things, or whatever.  But sitting down and focusing exclusively on a novel actually transports us out of the chair and into some other part of existence.  Really, what more engaging and focused activity could there possibly be?\n\n### Coda\n\nIn the course of writing this, I've realized there's an important piece of information missing.  The subject of all these actions is vital to their level of completion, and to your understanding of the task.  Jay-Z and J.S. Bach; a Ferrari F40 and a Geo Metro; Sutter Home and Ch. Lafite-Rothschild; someone you know and someone you love - these things aren't the same.  The appreciation, satisfaction, and understanding of life we derive from these activities are linked ineffably to their subject matter.\n","html":"<p>Wow.  That's a really long post title.  It gets the point across though.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight I stopped by my friends' house to hang out for a little while.  We sat in the kitchen and chatted briefly before somehow deciding unconsciously that we needed to be <em>doing</em> something.  You know, play a board game, or watch basketball, or.. something.  I'm not really sure why though.  Is it so hard now to simply do one thing?  To just talk.  To just sit.  To do one thing at a time, instead of, <em>shudder</em> multitask.</p>\n\n<p>I still sort of remember the first time I heard the word multitask.  I heard it while working at a help desk in a hospital.  A user called in complaining that she couldn't multitask any longer with her computer running so slowly.  To a high school student, and as a new term, it sounded decidedly business-like and grown up.  Quickly though, I realized it was simply doublespeak for being efficient.  The interesting thing about the growth of the concept is that it seems to parallel the progress computers have made at being ubiquitous in our lives.  Only ubiquitous isn't the right word for multitasking.  Perhaps insidious is more appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>What the hell did people do before multitasking existed?  How did they survive without Tivo, DVDs, Playstation, and, the biggest distraction ever, the infinitely knowledgeable Internet.  What did kids do on car rides before Nintendo?</p>\n\n<p>It seems we stay busy now because we're used to it.  We never simply pause.</p>\n\n<pre><code>    \"What is this life if, full of care,\n    We have no time to stand and stare?—\"\n    W.H. Davies\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Originally, I guess this seemed like a great goal.  If we could cram in as much as possible we could get more done and know more stuff.  It never works out that way though.  When you do 3 things at once, you give them each 33% of your attention, not 100% of it.  The information equivalent is trading knowledge for raw data.  What good is the data?  Does it really matter if you can't extract knowledge?  The world very clearly answers no in a lot of cases.  But dear God, look at what cultures can do by focusing on perfecting something exclusively.  Read up on the intricacy and beauty of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_tea_ceremony\">Japanese Tea Ceremony</a> for instance, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calligraphy\">Calligraphy</a>, or even.. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_knuth\">Donald Knuth</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, yes I know, strange tact (that is, if you know who Donald Knuth is).  But really, Knuth is the developer of the Japanese Tea Ceremony while all the rest of us just drink Lipton.  We drink a lot of tea, but we haven't figured out the economies of motion that produce grace, and we never even intuit a deeper meaning to what we're doing.  Knuth paused an entire lifetime, and devoted it to the perfection of a brand new art, computer programming.  And isn't it a wonder that his books are the ultimate resource for the fundamentals of the entire field.  Want to really learn Computer Science?  Fine, go grab <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming\">TAOCP</a> and spend <a href=\"http://norvig.com/21-days.html\">10 years</a> with them.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, Knuth is one of the most fascinating anachronisms in all of culture right now.  He's built or recorded the fundamentals of an entire field known for subverting people's attention and producing short attention spans (and employing people with the same) through an unbelievable discipline and single-minded devotion.</p>\n\n<p>Ok, I really didn't want to go off on a tangent about anything remotely related to computer science.  What I was really thinking about was the effort it takes to do something, and to do it well.  To understand any task takes a certain amount of time, devotion, and effort.  But that understanding does wonderful things to your well being.  It's relaxing and comforting and does an amazing job at keeping you sane.  It provides reason and meaning.</p>\n\n<p>And lo! most of the things that are crucially important to keeping us (or at least me) sane and allowing us to pause are things we already do, but don't really take notice of.  So I've tried to compile a brief list of some things that ought to be done exclusively sometimes.  They shouldn't be multitasked, and they shouldn't be shunted aside.  When done by themselves, they allow us to unwind.  To think deeply rather than go scatterbrained.  They increase our quality of life.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"listentomusic\">Listen to music</h3>\n\n<p>There's an important distinction between background noise and foreground sound.  Most of our listening now is completely secondary to other tasks, usually driving, working or dining.  I'm listening to music as I write this.  Even listening to an iPod while walking places the music secondary to some more essential task.</p>\n\n<p>Every once in awhile I put in a CD, turn off the lights, and just sit and listen.  Real music and real listening.   It's wonderfully refreshing to actually allow oneself to be carried away by the performance.  Music can evoke a journey and an emotion better than almost anything else in this world.  Of course, this paragraph would be useless without a shameless plug for some of my own musical selections: Rachmaninoff (Vespers, Piano Concerto No. 2), Paganini, Bach (Chaconne from Partita No. 2 stands alone in music to me), Alkan's Four Ages of Man, Jeff Buckley, Johnny Cash, Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Tom Waits, and others.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driveacar\">Drive a car</h3>\n\n<p>This one might be specific to me, I'm not sure.  Especially on a nice day, one of my favorite things to do is hop in my car and blast.  I drive all the time, but usually it's to and from work, or in traffic, or when I'm in a hurry.  But cruising down a country lane with the windows down is one of the most freeing, relaxing feelings I've encountered.  It's a very physical manifestation of leaving your troubles in your wake.  It's for those moments that people actually care about the car they drive.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drinkwine\">Drink wine</h3>\n\n<p>I know a lot of people who drink wine.  I know very few who really pause to understand what they drink.  People are generally scared of what they don't understand yet, and like to cover their fear with disinterest.  But understanding doesn't have to begin with knowledge of varietals in their region.  In fact, that's usually the last thing that happens.  No, the first thing that happens is when someone decides to stick their nose into a glass and pay attention.   Then, usually by luck or recommendation, they might actually find something beyond grape juice.  Is it fruit, earth, or something else?  Whatever that first true experience provides, it's intriguing.</p>\n\n<p>Drinking a good bottle of wine, all by itself, is a love affair complete with all the acts, from anticipation to fond memory.  It makes you think clearly about the world.  It's been said of a particularly stunning wine, Chateau d'Yquem Sauternes, that \"Yquem is, it seems, history, poetry, perhaps life itself rolled into a  wine and bottled\".  The movie <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375063/\">Sideways</a> is a wonderful exposition of the wine experience.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"eat\">Eat</h3>\n\n<p>Last weekend I went to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse with two friends from work.  It was my first time there.  It was fabulous.  Before the food was brought out, there was some conversation, and there was more over a cigar later.  But during the meal there was very nearly silence.  All of us were far too busy savoring the meal.  This sounds rude or uncomfortable at first, but it was a communal choice, and we shared a wonderful meal.  The focus was the food.</p>\n\n<p>The best meal I ever had was in Italy, at <a href=\"http://www.hostarialangolodelbeato.it/hostaria.asp\">Hostaria L'angolo Del Beato</a>, and it was a lot of courses.  There was extremely enjoyable conversation, but again there was focus on the food and the experience.  When it all comes together - great companionship, great food, great atmosphere - it's a remarkable experience.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"writetosomeoneyoulove\">Write to someone you love</h3>\n\n<p>Just as we seem to have traded knowledge for raw data, we also seem to have traded substantial correspondence for email.  This downward trend will just continue further with IM, social networking, and Twitter.  Sometimes though, things <em>ought</em> to be said that <em>can't</em> be said in simple little sound bytes and one liners.  It can be dramatically useful, not only for the recipient but also for the writer, to express deeper workings of the mind on paper.  The more I write, the more I realize how tied my thoughts are to my words.  Why not share them with someone close to you?</p>\n\n<p>This can be a practical matter too.   In many cases, a lot of what we know of historical figures can be found in their correspondence with others.  Do you think your great grandchildren will read your old emails?  Do you want them to know who you are?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"readabook\">Read a book</h3>\n\n<p>Funny how often reading has come up so far on here.  I knew I thought reading was important, but this is getting ridiculous.</p>\n\n<p>Reading is one of my very favorite activities.  Specifically novels.  I do a lot of reading every day, I make sure to, but I rarely set aside time for it.  Most of it is accomplished on the run, or in between other things, or whatever.  But sitting down and focusing exclusively on a novel actually transports us out of the chair and into some other part of existence.  Really, what more engaging and focused activity could there possibly be?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"coda\">Coda</h3>\n\n<p>In the course of writing this, I've realized there's an important piece of information missing.  The subject of all these actions is vital to their level of

It was spent leisurely - walking about, peeking into little shops, eating.  We trekked up to Salthill, a slightly ritzier area just west of the town center.  Apparently there's a wall around that has the magical ability to add seven years to your life should you kick it.  Our expected time to burial remains unchanged however, as it's a hidden wonder, especially from foolish stateside travels that happen to hear of it. \n\nAfter dinner at Busker Brown, Libby took us to the Quays, one of the more famous pubs situated along Shop Street.  Culturally, this was the highlight of Galway.  I'm not much of a pubfarer, but they do things right in Ireland.  Pubs seem filled with all walks of life.  The Quays is situated on at least 4 levels with a different bar in every direction.  Picture something Jack Sparrow would walk into and your mental image won't be far from target.  Here, it's all rich woods, soft lights, and detritus from a long and varied history.  When we arrived, Liverpool fans were focused intently on the match against Chelsea, which turned into quite a spectacle.  After everyone's disappointment (except for a poor, lone Chelsea fan), much hilarity, drinking, and good times ensued amidst the sounds of a Johnny Cash style trio.\n\nWe had originally planned on hitting other pubs, but between still being behind from the flight and an early departure for the ferry, it was a relatively early night.\n\n#### The Islands\n\nWe traveled early by bus up the Connemera coast west of Galway.  The view was a steady gradient from the relative urban scene of Galway out to green and grey hills dotted with stones everywhere, and mountains in the distance.  The Irish seem to have built right on top of the works of earlier generations.  New houses sprout up between ancient stone walls and ruins from various epochs, all spaced willy-nilly.  In the states, there would be preservation committees to ensure such drama was controlled, but the seeming carelessness of the whole thing actually enhances the experience, and adds to the culture and the understanding of the past.  I suppose when relics older than two hundred years aren't such a commodity, the task of continuing a legacy becomes dramatically easier.\n\nThe Aran Islands are a legacy of Ireland unto themselves.  Life on the islands is an approximation of what Ireland has been like for much of it's history.  We visited Inishmor, the largest at 9 miles long and a population of about 750.  The tiny harbor is the center of the island, and the location of its single village - Kilronan.  After securing our room, we rented bikes and set out to tour the island.  \n\nThere's a great scene in Braveheart where an Irishman comes to join William Wallace.  He speaks of Ireland as his possession.  \"It's my island\", he says with a more than slightly insane and devilish look on his face.  It's easy to see where some of that insanity comes from here.  The landscape possesses a slightly tyrannical, insane beauty.  It's physically imperious, while somehow still retaining elegance.\n\nI felt very much as if I was in a land still clinging to the past.  Just as in Tolkien's middle earth, the ancients left remnants of their previous everyday triumphs.  The island is covered with tiny fields demarcated by seemingly impossible stone walls.  The people, over what must have been centuries, have cleared much of the island of the stones that once littered it, and produced the walls that exist now.  They contain no mortar or any other substance; rather, the locals realized that the wind that pummels the island would be neutralized by leaving large gaps in the walls.  As a byproduct, the walls look very unsturdy, while actually being the opposite.  \n\nWe biked across the island, stopping frequently, on our way to the main attraction - Dun Aengus.  The \"base station\" for this ancient fort was situated just off a cove with a white sandy beach straight from the Mediterranean.  The water was turquoise and yet still managed to seem in keeping with the island's personality.\n\nDun Aengus is the oldest prehistoric fort in Europe, perched atop 200 foot cliffs on the very edge of the Atlantic.  It was built here over three thousand years ago for who knows what reason, and occupies a commanding view in every direction.  The design of the fort is several simple concentric circles built and enhanced throughout the centuries.  We parked our bikes and hiked the long and strenuous stretch up to the cliffs, the many soon-to-be octogenarians making our shortness of breath trivial along the way.\n\nThe reward at the top was worth it.  All the little stone-lined fields we passed earlier seem huddled together, completely engulfed by the gaping Atlantic.  This may have been the last view of land Columbus had entrenched in his head across the Atlantic.  (His last stop before the crossing was in Galway; we visited the church he prayed at for safety.)  \n\nMy first impression of the fort itself actually brought me back to childhood memories of watching The Princess Bride.  The plain atop the clifs look exactly like the Cliffs of Insanity.  I kept listening to the wind to catch Inigo telling the Man in Black about his father's swordmaking craft before their epic, swashbuckling battle.\n\n*\"You are using Boletti's defence against me, yes?\"\n\"I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain..\"*\n\nWe had lunch atop Dun Aengus, trekked back down, and continued on bike down to the far end of the island.  Here we found seven ancient churches, which turned out to be three, with bits and pieces of others, surrounded by a beautiful cemetery still in use.  Parts of the church walls dated to the original, from the 8th century, with other parts dating to medieval times.  Interestingly, once the church was no longer used, the cemetery overflowed inside the walls, and now the entire original floor space of the church is taken up by graves.\n\nAfter much picture taking and lots of altitude changes on bike, we made it back to Kilronan at about 5:30.  We collapsed on our beds until hunger finally roused us for dinner.  Luckily, the island has several restaurant choices, and the food turned out to be fabulous.  We had brought a bottle of Madeira (and a cigar of course) to finish the night, before retiring early.  The morning ferry left punctually at 8 am, and we would need our wits for the drive across the countryside to the Cliffs of Moher and Dublin.\n","html":"<p>We had a full day for exploring Galway before embarking for Inishmor.

Here, it's all rich woods, soft lights, and detritus from a long and varied history.  When we arrived, Liverpool fans were focused intently on the match against Chelsea, which turned into quite a spectacle.  After everyone's disappointment (except for a poor, lone Chelsea fan), much hilarity, drinking, and good times ensued amidst the sounds of a Johnny Cash style trio.</p>\n\n<p>We had originally planned on hitting other pubs, but between still being behind from the flight and an early departure for the ferry, it was a relatively early night.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"theislands\">The Islands</h4>\n\n<p>We traveled early by bus up the Connemera coast west of Galway.  The view was a steady gradient from the relative urban scene of Galway out to green and grey hills dotted with stones everywhere, and mountains in the distance.  The Irish seem to have built right on top of the works of earlier generations.  New houses sprout up between ancient stone walls and ruins from various epochs, all spaced willy-nilly.  In the states, there would be preservation committees to ensure such drama was controlled, but the seeming carelessness of the whole thing actually enhances the experience, and adds to the culture and the understanding of the past.  I suppose when relics older than two hundred years aren't such a commodity, the task of continuing a legacy becomes dramatically easier.</p>\n\n<p>The Aran Islands are a legacy of Ireland unto themselves.  Life on the islands is an approximation of what Ireland has been like for much of it's history.  We visited Inishmor, the largest at 9 miles long and a population of about 750.  The tiny harbor is the center of the island, and the location of its single village - Kilronan.  After securing our room, we rented bikes and set out to tour the island.  </p>\n\n<p>There's a great scene in Braveheart where an Irishman comes to join William Wallace.  He speaks of Ireland as his possession.  \"It's my island\", he says with a more than slightly insane and devilish look on his face.  It's easy to see where some of that insanity comes from here.  The landscape possesses a slightly tyrannical, insane beauty.  It's physically imperious, while somehow still retaining elegance.</p>\n\n<p>I felt very much as if I was in a land still clinging to the past.  Just as in Tolkien's middle earth, the ancients left remnants of their previous everyday triumphs.  The island is covered with tiny fields demarcated by seemingly impossible stone walls.  The people, over what must have been centuries, have cleared much of the island of the stones that once littered it, and produced the walls that exist now.  They contain no mortar or any other substance; rather, the locals realized that the wind that pummels the island would be neutralized by leaving large gaps in the walls.  As a byproduct, the walls look very unsturdy, while actually being the opposite.  </p>\n\n<p>We biked across the island, stopping frequently, on our way to the main attraction - Dun Aengus.  The \"base station\" for this ancient fort was situated just off a cove with a white sandy beach straight from the Mediterranean.  The water was turquoise and yet still managed to seem in keeping with the island's personality.</p>\n\n<p>Dun Aengus is the oldest prehistoric fort in Europe, perched atop 200 foot cliffs on the very edge of the Atlantic.  It was built here over three thousand years ago for who knows what reason, and occupies a commanding view in every direction.  The design of the fort is several simple concentric circles built and enhanced throughout the centuries.  We parked our bikes and hiked the long and strenuous stretch up to the cliffs, the many soon-to-be octogenarians making our shortness of breath trivial along the way.</p>\n\n<p>The reward at the top was worth it.  All the little stone-lined fields we passed earlier seem huddled together, completely engulfed by the gaping Atlantic.  This may have been the last view of land Columbus had entrenched in his head across the Atlantic.  (His last stop before the crossing was in Galway; we visited the church he prayed at for safety.)  </p>\n\n<p>My first impression of the fort itself actually brought me back to childhood memories of watching The Princess Bride.  The plain atop the clifs look exactly like the Cliffs of Insanity.  I kept listening to the wind to catch Inigo telling the Man in Black about his father's swordmaking craft before their epic, swashbuckling battle.</p>\n\n<p><em>\"You are using Boletti's defence against me, yes?\"\n\"I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain..\"</em></p>\n\n<p>We had lunch atop Dun Aengus, trekked back down, and continued on bike down to the far end of the island.  Here we found seven ancient churches, which turned out to be three, with bits and pieces of others, surrounded by a beautiful cemetery still in use.  Parts of the church walls dated to the original, from the 8th century, with other parts dating to medieval times.  Interestingly, once the church was no longer used, the cemetery overflowed inside the walls, and now the entire original floor space of the church is taken up by graves.</p>\n\n<p>After much picture taking and lots of altitude changes on bike, we made it back to Kilronan at about 5:30.  We collapsed on our beds until hunger finally roused us for dinner.  Luckily, the island has several restaurant choices, and the food turned out to be fabulous.  We had brought a bottle of Madeira (and a cigar of course) to finish the night, before retiring early.  The morning ferry left punctually at 8 am, and we would need our wits for the drive across the countryside to the Cliffs of Moher and Dublin.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"de_DE","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2008-05-03T03:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2008-05-03T03:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2008-05-03T03:00:00.000Z","published_by":1,"visibility":"public","mobiledoc":null,"amp":null},{"id":16,"uuid":"d4f435f2-00f9-4aee-a539-26b649b7b978","title":"Driving to the Cliffs of Moher","slug":"driving_to_the_cliffs_of_moher","markdown":"#### Pictures\n\nJust a quick note to say that, even though I'm way behind in detailing my recollections of this trip, all of the Ireland pictures are up, along with most of the pictures from the UK and France.\n\n[Pictures are here.](http://riskman.smugmug.com)\n\n#### Cliffs of Moher\n\nAfter the trip back down the Connemara coast, we stopped at the Budget rental agency on Eyre Square to pick up our car.  I was pleased we were starting the driving portion of the trip in a smaller city and heading off to Dublin rather than the other way around.  This would give me a chance to get acquainted with mirroring all of my driving habits without having to navigate the streets of a city.  We picked up our Ford Focus and all of our stuff from Libby's apartment where we had left it, and got under way.\n\nDriving in Ireland was a real pleasure, especially on the west coast.  It was also a lot easier to adapt to than I had expected.  Mind, I've driven a fair number of odd cars with all sorts of configurations, so I'm sure that helped with a quick change.  The toughest things were actually inside the car - looking for the rear view mirror or the gear shift in the right place; the road itself was rather easy.  I hope I didn't scare Katie or Libby too badly on the way to the Cliffs, but the roads were outrageous fun.  They were all narrow little lanes guarded on each side by either high grass embankments or little stone walls, with only the occasional straightaway and a 100 kph speed limit.  Picture an autocross course where the penalty for hitting a cone is a little more than 2 seconds and you'll have the general idea.  The precision required is similar.  My only dissatisfaction was having such an underpowered pig (Neil's Focus ST would have been great), but I didn't mind the economy when it was time to fill up at 1.20Euro/ltr (that's somewhere above $7.50/gallon).  \n\nWe reached the Cliffs of Moher sometime after lunch and walked up the paths to the main views of the cliffs.  The tourist facilities are extremely well done, blending in well with the scenery.  The safety walls are also embedded into the hillside so as not to break the lines of the cliff tops.  The cliffs themselves plunge anywhere from 300 feet to 700 feet directly downwards to the Atlantic.  The view includes the Aran Islands we had recently visited, as well as some of County Galway to the far north.  There are two towers on the cliffs; both could more aptly be described as follies.\n\nJust as we were about to leave for Dublin, we decided to trek up the other side of the cliffs where there were only dirt trails and no safety barriers.  We were held up moving past the enormous \"DO NOT PASS THIS POINT\" sign by two elderly women just as a large crash and splash could be heard emanating from down the cliffs.  By the time we could look down to see there were only waves again, but apparently a portion of the cliff face had fallen off.  A nearby ranger, who also seemed to have no qualms moving past the prominent signage into prohibited territory, confirmed that this happens only a couple of times a year.  Pity my camera wasn't ready!\n\nAfter some obligatory pictures as near to the cliffs as we could (solely to scare our mothers), we set off for Dublin, passing through Limerick and then picking up the M7.  Highway driving was a dream and, until we got into Dublin proper, it was actually easier to navigate than in the US.  We arrived late at the Kingfisher, checked into our flat, and grabbed a quick dinner at the Belvedere Bar just off Parnell Square before collapsing, exhausted.\n\n#### Dublin\n\nWe had two full days in Dublin, which I thought was more than enough to see all the most important parts of the city.  I rather preferred the countryside and little towns to the big city.  First up was a trip down into the heart of the city by way of O'Connell Street, the largest thoroughfare in Ireland.  Halfway down to the river Liffey, there is a very tall freestanding metal spire.  The official name is unknown to me (and lots of others I think), but it is horribly misplaced in what is otherwise a very beautiful stone and brick city.  The residents of Dublin seem to have an inkling of this as well, as the spire has been bestowed with the nickname \"Stiffy by the Liffey\" among even more imaginative suggestions.\n\nOur first stop in the heart of Dublin was Trinity College and all of it's treasures.  The life of the city seems to center around the college.  All the main civil buildings, parks, and commercial districts are huddled in its shadow.  Perhaps the most famous attraction at Trinity College is the Book of Kells, an ancient illuminated manuscript of the Gospels.  It was written in the 8th century on vellum and has been passed down as a treasure, narrowly avoiding destruction or confiscation several times.  Before you actually get to see some pages from the book, you pass through several rooms describing its history.  Therein are displayed very large illuminated photographs of pages from the Book of Kells.  One would think this to be suitable preparation, but it falls short.  The book itself is no more than 12 by 15 inch pages, done in an absolutely remarkably clean and elegant script.  Every important word or letter has some sort of filigreed embellishment, and some pages are solely decorative Celtic script and design.  It's breathtaking to stare and consider the countless hours of effort required by monks twelve hundred years ago to study, understand, and write the Gospels, nevermind the time necessary to procure and produce the vellum and inks required.  (One particular screen suggests that 185 calfs were used to produce the vellum required.)\n\nAfter moving on from the Book of Kells, visitors proceed through the Long Room - the oldest and most prestigious part of Trinity College's vast library.  Somewhere in heaven, there's a library that contains every copy of every book ever written by human hands (as well as others, I'm sure).  Obviously, it's a prestigious place, full of inquisitive minds, smelling of old polished wood and buckram, beautifully made and furnished, and lined with ladders, little reading corners, and books that extend beyond sight.  Until I get there and see it, the image in my mind will be the Long Room in Trinity College Library.\n\nThe weather was still somehow cooperating with us, so we spent some time lounging on St. Stephen's Green before heading to Grafton Street to do some shopping.  As the primary shopping center of the city, Grafton is lined with all manner of shops and stores.  The street itself is filled with acts looking to pick up change from passersby, from musicians to talking statues to limbo routines.  I stopped off in an alley as there appeared to be a church just off the main hustle and bustle.  It turned out to be a grand old gothic revival church with a Wedding in progress and a beautiful choir.  I couldn't believe it was there tucked down a little alleyway in such close proximity to all these shoppers.  That's the thing about European cities.  They're *lived in*.  There aren't zoning codes, commercial districts, or convenience stores to get in the way.  The cities grew organically over a long history, and that produces all the charm, quaintness, and vitality we associate with them.\n\nThe next day we went to Mass at a beautiful old church called St. John and St. Augustin - it turns out that St. Patrick's Cathedral is Church of Ireland.  Then it was on to the Guinness Storehouse.  That seems like a fitting Irish Sunday - church and beer.  The storehouse sits on the location of the original plant, adjacent to the current facilities.  Arthur Guinness signed a 9,000 year lease, so it won't be going anywhere anytime soon.  Guinness appears to be sort of a religion; I did my best to become a disciple, but I've never been a beer drinker, and especially not the darker lagers like Guinness.  But it was still worth a trip.  That night Katie and Libby headed out to Temple Bar.  Being the fuddy-duddy I am, I stayed in to pack and relax, and prepare for the British leg of the trip.\n","html":"<h4 id=\"pictures\">Pictures</h4>\n\n<p>Just a quick note to say that, even though I'm way behind in detailing my recollections of this trip, all of the Ireland pictures are up, along with most of the pictures from the UK and France.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://riskman.smugmug.com\">Pictures are here.</a></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"cliffsofmoher\">Cliffs of Moher</h4>\n\n<p>After the trip back down the Connemara coast, we stopped at the Budget rental agency on Eyre Square to pick up our car.

And this is coming from a seriously big car enthusiast.  Over the course of this trip I travelled by foot, bicycle, motorbike, car, bus, coach, underground, train, boat, and plane.  We only used a car when we had to, the rest of the time we used the infrastructure in place.  It was more pleasant, easier, and didn't detract from the day the way that sitting in a car seems to.  I'll have more to say about this at some point soon, but for now I just wanted to interject that little comment.\n\nLibby and I slept in to recover a bit from our travels, and got a late start Tuesday morning.  Besides, the prices on the trains into London go down after the morning commute, so it made sense to wait.  We grabbed Travelcards for the day, which we could use on trains, tubes, and buses, and hopped on the train for the 30 minute ride down into Liverpool Street Station.\n\nOnce we got there it took a little while to get our bearings.  We were stocked with maps and information, but London is a *big* place.  We adjusted, and made our way down to the river and thence to the Tower of London, our first stop.  What appeared to be a quick jaunt from the station ended up being a significant distance.  We resolved to use the tubes and buses in the future.\n\n#### Tower of London\n\nThe Tower of London is a big fort.  The name presupposes a single structure; in fact it includes several layers, multiple towers, and the fortress of the White Tower in the central Tower Green.  The whole site sits directly on the Thames and is surrounded by a depressed field of green that once served as a moat.  Having just walked down through parts of modern, commercial London, the [contrast created by the tower](http://riskman.smugmug.com/gallery/4897047_5BaQT#292271427_9SKoT-L-LB) was pronounced.  It directly evokes a sense of the history of the city, and that it is still being created and recreated.\n\nLibby and I grabbed our 2-for-1 tickets with a coupon, a convenient trick if you take the train into the city, and immediately joined a large group for the next tour of the Tower by one of the [Yeoman Warders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeomen_Warders), who serve as guides among their other ceremonial duties.  Their [curious dress uniform](http://riskman.smugmug.com/gallery/4897047_5BaQT#292268708_LHqdL-A-LB) suits the rather gothic history of the Tower.\n\nA tour at the Tower of London is an absolute must for any visitor.  The Warders are phenomenal storytellers, weaving legend, spectacle, history, and fact seamlessly to paint life onto historical figures.  Our guide was particularly good at scaring the children with dramatic pauses and exclamations, generally right at the most grisly point of his tale.  He led us down the main road to the Bloody Tower and Traitor's Gate, and then inside the main fortifications.  In the center of the tower green stands the White Tower, built by William the Conqueror shortly after his victory at Hastings in 1066.  We ended in St. Peter ad Vincula (\"in chains\", even the chapel here has a slightly macabre name), one of the seven Royal Chapels.  Here are buried two wives of Henry VIII, St. Thomas More, St. John Fisher, and, underneath the floor, hundreds of other bodies discovered after renovations in the previous century.\n\nAfter the official tour, Libby and I continued on to view the Crown Jewels and to make our way through the White Tower.  The sheer amount of glittering history (literally, the Star of Africa has a lot of glitter) present here leaves a first time visitor a bit breathless.  The Bloody Tower is particularly somber due to its history, specifically that of the [Princes of the Tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes_in_the_Tower) made famous by Shakespeare's play, Richard III.  It's now setup as a recreation of Sir Walter Raleigh's living quarters while he was imprisoned there, but it's hard not to walk through and consider the demise of the two boy-princes.\n\n#### St. Paul's Cathedral\n\nWe spent a lot more time at the Tower than either of us had expected, so we grabbed a late lunch and hitched a ride on the second level of a big red bus over to St. Paul's.  We unfortunately arrived late to tour the Whispering Galleries and view London from the cupola, but did manage to visit the large crypt as well as the main floor.  The crypt has several famous graves, notably (for me) Christopher Wren, JMW Turner, and John Singer Sargent.  The general plan of St. Paul's resembles many cathedrals in the nave and quire, but stands more grandiose in scale and ornament.  The spectacular dome is the second largest in the world behind St. Peter's in Rome.  The quire specifically is eye catching, covered in gilded gold and wood.  As one early visitor said, *\"Without, within, below, above, the eye is filled with unrestrained delight.\"*\n\n#### The Evening\n\nAfter pulling ourselves away, we crossed the Thames on the Millennium Bridge to see the Tate.  But unfortunately the Tate Modern is distinct from the Tate Britain and neither Libby or I are too keen on modern art.  We stopped briefly at the replica of Shakespeare's Globe theatre on the south side of the river before making our way back to Liverpool Street Station to meet Neil, Sue, and Liane for dinner.  They took us to an S&M Cafe amidst the requisite, obvious jokes from Neil (ha! :P).  Sausage & Mash was raised to a bit of an artform, and we devoured 20-odd sausages and a huge bed of mashed potatoes and gravy.  Duly sated, Neil and Sue showed us a couple of smaller hidden wonders, including an ancient piece of Roman edifice sitting directly beneath glass at the base of an office building, a curry district along Brick Lane filled with insistent hawkers, and a doubledecker bus turned restaurant.  After tea, we made our way back town to the main excitement of the night, back at the Tower of London.\n\n#### The Ceremony of the Keys\n\nIf the tower seemed foreboding in daylight, it had a slightly ghastly demeanor in the evening.  We waited at one of the gates with a small crowd to see something special.  Sue had procured four tickets to the [Ceremony of the Keys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremony_of_the_keys) - a hallmark of history unchanged.  As my grandmother wrote to me, *\"This is English monarchical tradition at its very best -- not a step of the ceremony has changed for hundreds of years.\"*  And so it hasn't, as we witnessed.  \n\nA Yeoman Warder took us through the Outer Ward and down to Traitor's Gate where we would observe.  He explained the ceremony and the significance it has had through the history of the Tower.  Then, just before 10 PM, the Watchman, accompanied by an armed military escort, proceeded to lock several layers of gates.  As he was walking back down to Traitor's Gate, he was challenged by an armed soldier - \"Halt!  Who comes there!\"  The Watchman provided an appropriate answer (\"The keys!\"), since the soldier let him pass.  The Watchman and his guard proceeded up to the Tower Green, where he shouted \"God preserve the Queen!\"  We all shouted \"Amen!\", and the Last Post was sounded.\n\nThe ride home was mostly silent.  Back on the east coast at -5 GMT, 5 PM has taken on a new significance, now that I know what goes on elsewhere in the world at the end of a normal workday.\n","html":"<h4 id=\"instatravel\">Insta-Travel!</h4>\n\n<p>This whole car thing is seriously overrated.  And this is coming from a seriously big car enthusiast.  Over the course of this trip I travelled by foot, bicycle, motorbike, car, bus, coach, underground, train, boat, and plane.  We only used a car when we had to, the rest of the time we used the infrastructure in place.  It was more pleasant, easier, and didn't detract from the day the way that sitting in a car seems to.  I'll have more to say about this at some point soon, but for now I just wanted to interject that little comment.</p>\n\n<p>Libby and I slept in to recover a bit from our travels, and got a late start Tuesday morning.  Besides, the prices on the trains into London go down after the morning commute, so it made sense to wait.  We grabbed Travelcards for the day, which we could use on trains, tubes, and buses, and hopped on the train for the 30 minute ride down into Liverpool Street Station.</p>\n\n<p>Once we got there it took a little while to get our bearings.  We were stocked with maps and information, but London is a <em>big</em> place.  We adjusted, and made our way down to the river and thence to the Tower of London, our first stop.  What appeared to be a quick jaunt from the station ended up being a significant distance.  We resolved to use the tubes and buses in the future.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"toweroflondon\">Tower of London</h4>\n\n<p>The Tower of London is a big fort.  The name presupposes a single structure; in fact it includes several layers, multiple towers, and the fortress of the White Tower in the central Tower Green.  The whole site sits directly on the Thames and is surrounded by a depressed field of green that once served as a moat.  Having just walked down through parts of modern, commercial London, the <a href=\"http://riskman.smugmug.com/gallery/4897047_5BaQT#292271427_9SKoT-L-LB\">contrast created by the tower</a> was pronounced.  It directly evokes a sense of the history of the city, and that it is still being created and recreated.</p>\n\n<p>Libby and I grabbed our 2-for-1 tickets with a coupon, a convenient trick if you take the train into the city, and immediately joined a large group for the next tour of the Tower by one of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeomen_Warders\">Yeoman Warders</a>, who serve as guides among their other ceremonial duties.  Their <a href=\"http://riskman.smugmug.com/gallery/4897047_5BaQT#292268708_LHqdL-A-LB\">curious dress uniform</a> suits the rather gothic history of the Tower.</p>\n\n<p>A tour at the Tower of London is an absolute must for any visitor.  The Warders are phenomenal storytellers, weaving legend, spectacle, history, and fact seamlessly to paint life onto historical figures.  Our guide was particularly good at scaring the children with dramatic pauses and exclamations, generally right at the most grisly point of his tale.  He led us down the main road to the Bloody Tower and Traitor's Gate, and then inside the main fortifications.  In the center of the tower green stands the White Tower, built by William the Conqueror shortly after his victory at Hastings in 1066.  We ended in St. Peter ad Vincula (\"in chains\", even the chapel here has a slightly macabre name), one of the seven Royal Chapels.  Here are buried two wives of Henry VIII, St. Thomas More, St. John Fisher, and, underneath the floor, hundreds of other bodies discovered after renovations in the previous century.</p>\n\n<p>After the official tour, Libby and I continued on to view the Crown Jewels and to make our way through the White Tower.  The sheer amount of glittering history (literally, the Star of Africa has a lot of glitter) present here leaves a first time visitor a bit breathless.

As usual, I was a little hesitant whenever I have no control and someone has something planned.  I just don't like that feeling.  Luckily, I usually like what's decided for me better than what I would've done.  And that's how it turned out.\n\nWe left early and got on the M25.  For the 73rd time, I asked where we were going.  For the first time I got an answer.  \"South,\" Sue said.  Brilliant.  Big help.  Saving it to the last minute!\n\nI was excited.\n\n#### Leeds Castle\n\nAfter a 40 minute drive, we took an exit with signs for Leeds Castle, and finally Neil and Sue announced our destination.  I was ecstatic.  Leeds ranked highest on my list of castles.  It's not the oldest or the biggest, but ever since my grandmother showed me a picture, I've been captivated.  \n\nWe chose to skip the hot air balloon available for arial views (I could never do that), and meandered through the grounds up to the castle.  The gardens are kept meticulously, and birds and flowers are everywhere.  We stopped at the barns behind the castle first to have tea, and were greeted with a [delightful view of the castle](http://riskman.smugmug.com/gallery/4897047_5BaQT#292274404_moRZ3-A-LB).  One of the keys to being a tourist is not being a tourist.  Every time I get in a rush to see all the touristy places, it ruins the joy of the process.  Vacation and travel is about taking a break and seeing new places, but just seeing them is not enough if you don't have time to reflect.  I was pleased to travel in England with natives who wanted to stop and have tea or check email.  It gave Libby and I a chance to absorb our surroundings.  In fact, I'm almost worried about visiting touristy sites, because you don't get a real sense of the place you're in.  The little towns and villages, in almost every case, are better than the big cities.\n\nAfter tea, we walked around the gardens behind the castle, which include an aviary and a maze.  The aviary is extensive, featuring toucans, parrots, hawks, owls and several species of endangered birds.  We didn't have time to get lost in the maze.  Instead, we made our way back to the bridge across to the castle.  Leeds is built on two small islands on a lake, and was added to extensively over the centuries to produce what exists now.  Only a short bridge of about 50 feet is required to pass from the bank to the keep entrance.  \n\nThe unguided walking tour takes you around the back of the castle so you can see [some of the outside](http://riskman.smugmug.com/gallery/4897047_5BaQT#292276291_qexJR-A-LB) as well.  Inside the castle are beautiful living quarters, some restored, along with banquet and conference facilities.  The very middle of the keep has a [small courtyard](http://riskman.smugmug.com/gallery/4897047_5BaQT#292277589_7qXtS-A-LB) with a fountain that exudes Roman influence.  Once we made our way back out, we stopped by the car to grab a picnic lunch, and shared our lunch with quite a few [peacocks](http://riskman.smugmug.com/gallery/4897047_5BaQT#292273656_wTHh6-XL-LB) and peahens.  We finished up, and hopped back in the car.  We weren't done yet.\n\n#### The Channel Tunnel\n\nWe continued south, and as we approached the coastline and the choices became fewer, I started to wonder about the Chunnel.  Finally, we grabbed an exit and Neil and Sue once again announced our destination: we were going to head over to France for dinner!  You know, no big deal.  Just a lazy little jaunt over to the continent through one of the wonders of the modern world to grab a bite.  Libby and I gave each other one of our many \"you've got to be kidding me\" looks of the day as we parked at the station.\n\nThe process for the Channel Tunnel is extremely well thought out.  We each bought a magazine at the store, went back to the car, and made our way up to customs.  On each side of the tunnel is customs for both England and France.  You take care of both countries before getting on the train, so you just start driving when you arrive.  The trains themselves are pretty intelligent too.  Cars are driven directly onto the trains (on two levels) through side doors.  About 30 minutes pass while you lounge in the car with your magazine or book.  The entire trip is extremely smooth - there's no feeling of speed at all.  Once you've arrived, you just start the car up and make sure you drive on the proper side of the road.\n\n#### France\n\nThe scenery immediately changed in France, but I'm still not sure how or why.  The air seemed cleaner, the architecture more country and quaint.  Bypassing Calais, we made our way down through farmlands to Wissant, a small vacation town with a [beautiful, wide strand of beach](http://riskman.smugmug.com/gallery/4897272_SbSGg#292287304_h9rzU-A-LB).  We stopped at the cafe on the edge of the beach for beer and wine.  After absorbing the scene through a glass of red wine, Libby and I went to take a walk along the beach.  You know, the beach in France.  On the continent.  Because we could.\n\nThe water was cold, but neither of us really cared.  Kitesurfers were skipping across the waves off the coast as children and parents were playing in the sand.  Tide seemed to be out, and little saltwater streams made their way back down to the surf every few hundred feet.  The farmlands reached right up to the bluffs above the beach, almost tipping over and into the water.  The [entire spectacle](http://riskman.smugmug.com/gallery/4897272_SbSGg#292287770_sA9bv-A-LB) forced me to consider what the American soldiers thought of the beach they climbed sixty years ago further down the coast.  How could so many wars develop over ideology here, in the midst of a continent whose geographic riches induce such culture?\n\nWe lingered as long as we could at the beach, before finding a restaurant for dinner and making our way back to the Chunnel terminal.  Like the night before, the ride back to Billericay was mostly reflective.\n","html":"<h4 id=\"onward\">Onward</h4>\n\n<p>I had been told to keep Wednesday open for some pre-scheduled events.

Like Tuesday, we had big plans to see a lot of London and came up short; not for lack of trying, but simply because every landmark in London is *so* remarkable.  The entire cityscape is built and outlined with the riches of the last thousand years.\n\n#### Westminster Abbey\n\nIn particular, Westminster was the big time killer for the day.  I could have spent the entire day there.  Westminster was founded sometime in the 9th or 10th century.  Over the next ten centuries, it has remained one of the epicenters for both spiritual and state power in Britain, and it's collection of graves and memorials is perhaps unrivaled throughout the entire world.  Only in Italy and the Holy Land can I think of any comparable sites, and they rival Westminster only in distinction and renown, not in volume.  \n\nVisitors enter the Abbey from the North entrance.  Libby and I passed on the guided audio tours, preferring to simply glide through all the little chapels and ambulatories.  In retrospect, this was a mistake.  I tried to go back to Westminster on Saturday, but it was closed for services.  Getting all the history while there seems important; it helps you absorb your surroundings.  Nevertheless, the walls seem to echo the voices of previous ages.  This enumeration of some of the highlights will serve only as the slightest glimpse into the experience.\n\nI had some small idea of how many people were buried at Westminster, but I never realized just how *cluttered* that would make the interior.  Graves and memorials overlap everywhere.  With the exception of the monarchs; the larger the memorial, the more uninteresting are it's occupants.  The aristocracy and lesser functionaries of the last three centuries seem especially preoccupied with the glamour and placement of their marble epitaphs.  One [particular example](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/391175/Monument-of-Lady-Elizabeth-Nightingale#assembly=url~%2FEBchecked%2Ftopic-art%2F391175%2F13894%2FMonument-of-Lady-Elizabeth-Nightingale-white-and-black-marble-sculpture) that seems to transcend the other tombs is that of Lady Elizabeth Nightingale.  Commissioned to the French sculptor Roubiliac, a cloaked, skeletal spectre is literally climbing out of the open tomb doors with his spear aimed at the Lady while her husband fruitlessly defends her.  \n\nIn the center of the nave is the Shrine of St. Edward the Confessor, surrounded by the sepulchers of seven lesser monarchs.  St. Edward is the reason for the existence of Westminster.  He had originally vowed to make a pilgrimage to St. Peter's Tomb in Rome, but after his ascendency to the throne was unable to do so.  Pope Leo IX wrote to Edward, asking him to use the monies set aside for the pilgrimage to aid the poor and to instead rebuild a monastery to honor St. Peter.  Edward chose the abbey on Thorney Island, and the original Westminster began. \n\nThe [Coronation Chair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Edward%27s_Chair) sits at the end of the Shrine.  Every monarch back to William the Conqueror in 1066 (with two exceptions) have been crowned in Westminster Abbey.  Since 1296, when this chair was commissioned, every monarch has been crowned while seated in it, with the [Stone of Scone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_of_Scone) securely in place underneath.\n\nThe East end of Westminster is the Lady Chapel, built by King Henry VII.  The [Lady Chapel](http://www.westminster-abbey.org/visitor/plan-of-the-abbey/henry-7-chapel/14385?article-images-selected-id=25479#images) is dominated by the exquisitely delicate ceiling, a marvel of 16th century stonework.  The banners of the Knights of the Order of Bath hang directly beneath.  Side chapels surrounding the Lady Chapel contain other graves, including Elizabeth I, her half-sister Mary I, and her half-cousin Mary, Queen of Scots.\n\nPoets' Corner was one of the highlights of the Abbey.  The tradition began with the burial of Chaucer and Spenser in Westminster.  Other luminaries resting here include Tennyson, Browning, Dickens, Carol, Kipling, the composer Handel, and the late actor Laurence Olivier.  The memorials are even more extensive.  Shakespeare has a commanding view of his lesser colleagues.  It's difficult to linger here without a small, thoughtful requiescat passing your lips.  Here lie some of the founders of our language, and by proxy, our very mode of thought.\n\nThe cloister outside the Abbey reminded us that this was once a working monastery.  Some of the older graves of Westminster's abbots line the walls, the names worn away from the marble.  One particularly large vault contains the remains of 26 monks who perished of the Black Death in 1349.  Passing back into the front of the Nave, we visited Britain's Tomb of the Unknown Warrior, on which our own monument was modeled.

Charles Darwin lies near the north wall of the nave.  Sir Isaac Newton is buried underneath a fittingly grand monument at the choir entrance.

Diligent, sagacious and faithful, in his expositions of nature, antiquity and the holy Scriptures, he vindicated by his philosophy the majesty of God mighty and good, and expressed the simplicity of the Gospel in his manners. Mortals rejoice that there has existed such and so great an ornament of the human race! He was born on 25th December, 1642, and died on 20th March 1726/7.*\"\n\n#### Some Side Trips\n\nAfter emerging into the sunlight, Libby and I paused for a moment to gather our faculties and take some pictures of the Parliament buildings and it's Clock Tower.  Still trailing the dust of history from Westminster, we examined these buildings in the same way.  It's hard to imagine what [Guy Fawkes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_fawkes) was thinking, wanting to explode a building of such quintessential English character.  But religious debates often create the most dramatic and lasting impressions, overtaking easily the culture and history of a people.  And Fawkes was but a later riposte to the [original debate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_viii#Church_of_England)!\n\nAfter lunch, we took the tube over to see Buckingham Palace and St. James's Park.  We unfortunately missed the Changing of the Guard earlier in the morning, so we didn't linger long.  Instead, we walked down to Harrod's Department Store, passing several incredibly ritzy hotels along the way.  The front carriageways were all filled with Bentleys, Rolls Royces, Ferraris, and Aston Martins.  Harrod's was a throwback to old world luxury, available now as a commodity.  I considered briefly a marble cigar holder I found between the Prada shoes and the Zegna belts, but its 200 Sterling price tag kept me safely away.\n\nOur next stop for the afternoon was, sadly, a mistake.  Libby and I both loved [Bedknobs & Broomsticks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedknobs_and_Broomsticks), so we decided to head out of our way to Portobello Road.  A little bit of research would have revealed that the *riches of ages are stowed* there only on Saturdays, when the market enlivens the entire area.  On a Thursday, the street was just another quaint little shop district of London.\n\nAnother shopping district, at Regent Street, was our last stop before meeting with Neil and Sue for the evening's entertainment.  I managed to royally screw up my power adapter by trying to convert 240V down to 110V when the upper limit of my transformer was 220V.  It blew up.  Luckily, the adapter did it's job and protected my computer.  But I still needed to get to the Apple Store and pay for my mistake.  The Apple Store was beautiful - two stories of gleaming glass and steel.  It was jam-packed with people too, as is every Apple store I see.  They really hit a home run with their stores.\n\nWe stopped in a few shops on Regent Street, most notably Burberry.  I found a pair of jeans I loved, but 165 Pounds ($330!) was a bit steep (*cough*).  So instead we made our way back into Soho and across to Leicester Square to find Neil and Sue.\n\n#### Spamalot!\n\nNeil wrangled a deal at one of the last minute ticket booths, and we grabbed balcony seats for [Monty Python's Spamalot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamalot) (Hairspray was sold out) for a steal.  Soho also contains the Chinatown district of London, considerably bigger than Washington's, so we perused the specials looking for one that matched Neil's taste (so demanding).  After, we walked over to the Palace Theatre for the show.  I grabbed an enormous glass of wine, which I gleefully took with me to my seat.\n\nWe laughed maniacally for the next two hours.  Spamalot has many of the same scenes as the movie (Holy Grail), along with some new bits and some uproarious songs.  The cast was fabulous and the sets were phenomenal.  The entire spectacle was filled with easy laughter and relaxation. \n\nWalking out, Neil hailed a taxi to get us back to Liverpool Street Station for the train home.  We were treated to a barrage of political discourse for the next twenty minutes by our cabby, who had quite a few things to say about London's new Mayor Boris.  We were home a half hour later, and finished the night with a cup of tea.  Libby was leaving early the next morning, so we said our goodbyes before bed.  I was a little sad and already a bit nostalgic about Ireland; it was fun to have such a good travel partner to see London (and two to see Ireland!)  And besides, I'd be stuck by myself with a bunch of blasted Brits for the next 3 days.\n\nI can think of worse fates.\n","html":"<p>Thursday was Libby's last day in Britain before flying back to Ireland for two more weeks in Galway.  Like Tuesday, we had big plans to see a lot of London and came up short; not for lack of trying, but simply because every landmark in London is <em>so</em> remarkable.  The entire cityscape is built and outlined with the riches of the last thousand years.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"westminsterabbey\">Westminster Abbey</h4>\n\n<p>In particular, Westminster was the big time killer for the day.  I could have spent the entire day there.  Westminster was founded sometime in the 9th or 10th century.  Over the next ten centuries, it has remained one of the epicenters for both spiritual and state power in Britain, and it's collection of graves and memorials is perhaps unrivaled throughout the entire world.  Only in Italy and the Holy Land can I think of any comparable sites, and they rival Westminster only in distinction and renown, not in volume.  </p>\n\n<p>Visitors enter the Abbey from the North entrance.  Libby and I passed on the guided audio tours, preferring to simply glide through all the little chapels and ambulatories.  In retrospect, this was a mistake.  I tried to go back to Westminster on Saturday, but it was closed for services.  Getting all the history while there seems important; it helps you absorb your surroundings.  Nevertheless, the walls seem to echo the voices of previous ages.  This enumeration of some of the highlights will serve only as the slightest glimpse into the experience.</p>\n\n<p>I had some small idea of how many people were buried at Westminster, but I never realized just how <em>cluttered</em> that would make the interior.  Graves and memorials overlap everywhere.  With the exception of the monarchs; the larger the memorial, the more uninteresting are it's occupants.  The aristocracy and lesser functionaries of the last three centuries seem especially preoccupied with the glamour and placement of their marble epitaphs.  One <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/391175/Monument-of-Lady-Elizabeth-Nightingale#assembly=url~%2FEBchecked%2Ftopic-art%2F391175%2F13894%2FMonument-of-Lady-Elizabeth-Nightingale-white-and-black-marble-sculpture\">particular example</a> that seems to transcend the other tombs is that of Lady Elizabeth Nightingale.  Commissioned to the French sculptor Roubiliac, a cloaked, skeletal spectre is literally climbing out of the open tomb doors with his spear aimed at the Lady while her husband fruitlessly defends her.  </p>\n\n<p>In the center of the nave is the Shrine of St. Edward the Confessor, surrounded by the sepulchers of seven lesser monarchs.  St. Edward is the reason for the existence of Westminster.  He had originally vowed to make a pilgrimage to St. Peter's Tomb in Rome, but after his ascendency to the throne was unable to do so.  Pope Leo IX wrote to Edward, asking him to use the monies set aside for the pilgrimage to aid the poor and to instead rebuild a monastery to honor St. Peter.  Edward chose the abbey on Thorney Island, and the original Westminster began. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Edward%27s_Chair\">Coronation Chair</a> sits at the end of the Shrine.  Every monarch back to William the Conqueror in 1066 (with two exceptions) have been crowned in Westminster Abbey.  Since 1296, when this chair was commissioned, every monarch has been crowned while seated in it, with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_of_Scone\">Stone of Scone</a> securely in place underneath.</p>\n\n<p>The East end of Westminster is the Lady Chapel, built by King Henry VII.  The <a href=\"http://www.westminster-abbey.org/visitor/plan-of-the-abbey/henry-7-chapel/14385?article-images-selected-id=25479#images\">Lady Chapel</a> is dominated by the exquisitely delicate ceiling, a marvel of 16th century stonework.  The banners of the Knights of the Order of Bath hang directly beneath.  Side chapels surrounding the Lady Chapel contain other graves, including Elizabeth I, her half-sister Mary I, and her half-cousin Mary, Queen of Scots.</p>\n\n<p>Poets' Corner was one of the highlights of the Abbey.  The tradition began with the burial of Chaucer and Spenser in Westminster.  Other luminaries resting here include Tennyson, Browning, Dickens, Carol, Kipling, the composer Handel, and the late actor Laurence Olivier.  The memorials are even more extensive.  Shakespeare has a commanding view of his lesser colleagues.  It's difficult to linger here without a small, thoughtful requiescat passing your lips.  Here lie some of the founders of our language, and by proxy, our very mode of thought.</p>\n\n<p>The cloister outside the Abbey reminded us that this was once a working monastery.  Some of the older graves of Westminster's abbots line the walls, the names worn away from the marble.  One particularly large vault contains the remains of 26 monks who perished of the Black Death in 1349.  Passing back into the front of the Nave, we visited Britain's Tomb of the Unknown Warrior, on which our own monument was modeled.  The soldier interred here, of unknown name or rank, was brought back from France after the Great War (World War I) and laid to rest under great ceremony and gravity - a fitting reminder of the price of nations.</p>\n\n<p>Two tombs remain that I feel the need to mention.

I got there on the back of Nigel's Yamaha DragStar, which he kept under 110 mph the whole way.  About 10 minutes in, after the initial new-ness of the experience, I started really getting hooked.

I never really *got it* though, until now.  But I'm hooked, finally.  Sometime this summer I hope to get my license and then pick up a bike late summer or fall.  My friend Mike let me ride his Suzuki Bandit 600 around a park a week ago, and even that brief ride was enough to keep me going.  A Suzuki SV650 seems like a great starter bike: cheap, easy to ride, and comfortable.

Since my trip I've had a bunch of other topics that have accumulated in sort of half finished form.  Presently they're all about as ambiguous as that last sentence, but hopefully I'll get them finished sooner then later.\n\n**And for no particular reason, this blog post is dedicated to Zoe.**\n\nFor most of my travel recollections, I've tried to focus a lot more on my activities and impressions at specific moments.  The real purpose was to log what I did so I could remember it.  I've mostly avoided any general themes from the entire trip, aside from asides, thinking it would be more valuable to contain them all in one place.  This is that place.\n\n#### Food\n\nWhen Katie and I grabbed a bagel in the airport in Dublin on our first morning, I think that shop might have been a chain.  Other than that one occasion, I can't remember eating at another chain restaurant.  Anywhere.  The entire time.\n\nThat means *alot*.  Going out and grabbing a quick meal in Europe means a quaint, unique little pub or shop.  In the States, a nice meal out with friends usually means a national chain restaurant of some sort (unless it's a *really* nice meal out) like a TGI Fridays, Subway, or Ruby Tuesday (or Bennigans or Applebee's or... ).  I've been thinking about this quite a bit since I've been back, because I eat out so much.  We have certain expectations of the prices in a reasonable, everyday restaurant.  A burger should be about 8 dollars.  Pasta dishes are 9-13, salads are 5-8 dollars.  That's quite cheap.  In Europe, the going prices are anywhere from 10-40% higher than that for the same meals.\n\nThe problem arises when we try to make an apples to apples comparison - these aren't the same meals.  That lovely pasta with red sauce dish you get in London is made with these things called tomatoes, a remarkable plant that translates quite wonderfully to red sauces.  American chains don't use tomatoes.  They manage to keep their prices even with American expectations by scaling their supply.  So they have suppliers that supply them with mass quantities of crap iceberg lettuce and tomato paste that their chain locations can ingest with a reasonable rate of return.  Meanwhile, the consumer gets their expected $6 caesar salad.  The lack in quality doesn't seem to bother most people, but they're still surprised when they hear that our obesity rates are so much higher than the rest of the Western World.\n\nWe have lots of preservatives and other artificial ingredients.  We make our sauces out of pastes or prepackaged nonsense instead of vegetables and other centuries old, basic food products.  We do all of this to keep prices down, but does it affect taste?  If our expectation for super cheap meals anywhere at anytime doesn't correspond to higher quality, do they at least taste the same or better?\n\nNope.\n\nAmerican food tastes like donkey shit.  Nearly all of it.  It might give you that warm fuzzy feeling on the first bite (you know the one I'm talking about - it's the way that first bite of a big nasty Papa John's pizza tastes), but it doesn't satisfy any desire beyond that, and it certainly doesn't make you feel any better after you finish your meal.\n\nEuropeans sacrifice price for quality and taste.  Americans do the opposite.  And it sucks.  And I'm tired of it.  One of my goals over the summer is to actually do something about this in my life.  A new Harris Teeter opened up in my neighborhood in May, and I hope to take advantage of it's selection of fresh ingredients and try to give my eating habits a European twist.  Since I'm just going on high cholesterol medicine right now, this is long overdue.\n\nOne other interesting thing about food in Europe: there's more selection.  Nearly anywhere you go with a population center - a village, town, or city - has an easy selection of pubs and restaurants you can walk into for a meal.  I'm pretty sure the village of Kilronan on the Aran Islands, with a population of about 500, had more restaurants than the village of Kings Contrivance here in Columbia with it's thousands of residents.\n\n#### Tea\n\nNearly everyone drinks tea.  It's a part of the culture.  I knew this struck me for awhile, but I couldn't quite figure out why.  When I do dinners with my friends, the evening usually ends with coffee, grappa or some other after dinner drink.  But the average lunch or dinner has no inclusion for digestives in America.  This whispers something about the cultural difference in the same way as France's 35 hour work weeks.  The average American consumes their meals on the run, with not a moment to spare.  We're always in a hurry, and we're almost certainly in too much of a rush to sit down for a few minutes, prepare tea, and drink it slowly and properly.  Not being capable of sitting down, even occasionally, to provide time for a proper meal is extremely unsettling.  I can't imagine why our kids are all diagnosed with ADHD.\n\n#### The Geography of Nowhere\n\nWhile I was gone I read Kunstler's *Geography of Nowhere*, a poignant description of American civic history.  Kunstler takes the reader through the various stages and historical movements that have brought us to suburbia - a state of being he calls \"the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world\".  I was quite pleased to be reading this while in Europe.  It kept all of his insights in the forefront of my mind as I admired the architecture, civic art, and city planning that exists outside the States.\n\nCities, towns, and villages elsewhere are all organic places grown over time.  They have morphed, changed, and been added to as needed.  They were *not* built by development corporations or golf courses.  They seem to have only a minimum for standards, zoning, and planning committees.  That minimum allows even the simplest civic requirement for culture, like shopping and restaurants at street level mixed in with housing.  In the United States, zoning laws generally prevent such things, demanding that residential areas be only houses.  But this also very naturally levies the car on everyone as a requirement to get anywhere.\n\nKunstler has some very scary things to say about the ramifications of the automobile on culture.  Things that make me hope gas prices keep rising.  We are in dire need of motivation to understand and build or rebuild a relevant American civic center which will allow culture to once again become a part of the country.  WWE, Bob Evans, Target and Walmart just don't cut it.\n\nSome interesting history that struck me:\n\n*  Back in the 20s and 30s, GM went around buying out streetcar companies just to dismantle them to ensure the continuing success of the automobile.</li>\n*  [Robert Moses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Moses) set quite an example in ensuring that the automobile was the only viable transportation system for New York City and surrounding areas.</li>\n*  Frederick Law Olmstead, more commonly known for Central Park and Biltmore, also designed Riverside, Illinois, one of the first planned communities in the United States.  Funny how such simple, well-intentioned initial conditions can balloon into a major problem like sprawl.</li>\n\nIn his essay [Made in USA](http://paulgraham.com/usa.html), Paul Graham talks about the ability of Americans to produce something quickly and messy and their ineptitude to produce something of high quality, good design, or general remarkability.  This seems to be a basic tenet of our entire history.  Even though our country is over 200 years old, the average town or city has very few, *if any*, structures older than 150 years.  Meanwhile, the tiniest village in Europe generally has ancient roots.\n\nIn a recent interview, Freeman Dyson shares an old quip: \"*The famous story goes, 'How do you make these beautiful British lawns?' and the answer is, 'Oh, you just roll them for 200 years.'  [The British] never thought of things in terms of quick returns.*\"\n\nAmericans don't think like this.  We never have, and until we slow down and start actually considering, on a very small scale, the world our great grandchildren will inherit, we never will.  We've become brilliant at producing and flipping simple commodities in any market, and that's gained us an interesting place at or near the top of the world economy.  But I'm not sure if this constant commodity producing and shifting activity can produce any sort of persistence.\n\nThere's also a [video version of some of Kunstler's thoughts](http://youtube.com/watch?v=Q1ZeXnmDZMQ) available.\n\n#### Driving\n\nI have a whole other post (maybe two) almost ready to go on driving, so I'll only touch on it briefly here.  Nearly everyone knows how to drive well in Europe.  It's not as if it is terribly hard, but it does take common sense.  And in the tradition of [Descartes](http://mhyrr.tumblr.com/post/39839565/common-sense-is-the-most-fairly-distributed-thing), Americans have that in spades.\n\nDriving was actually pleasant in Ireland.  The speed limits were equitable, the drivers courteous, and the signage visible.  In fact, it was actually easier to navigate than here because the signs were so good.\n\nThe roads were consistent too.  Every single freeway or exit was on the left; not one required the fast lane to suddenly become the exit lane.  Nobody passed on the left.  People stopped when the light turned.  It was an entirely different experience to American traffic.\n\n#### Travel\n\nTravel packs so many experiences into a small period of time that it becomes nearly impossible to keep up.  Even though I tried to get a bunch of thoughts down for everything we did on the trip, I still barely remarked on it all.  This could just be because writing is *so damn hard*.  It really is.  I enjoy it a lot, but it's a great way to stay humble.  But I didn't want to talk about writing, I wanted to talk about travel.  (See there's one of those difficulties - it's so hard to not go off on every tangent.)\n\nI never really had a huge desire to travel growing up.  I remember going to San Francisco and Yosemite National Park when I was not quite a teenager, and I remember loving those places.  But the embers were never lit until I went to Italy for a wedding of two great friends of mine.  The experiences flooded me there, and I began thinking seriously about the rest of the world and what it might be like to live in other places.  Menaggio on the shores of Lake Como became my new home for retirement dreams.\n\nOne of the things I was hoping to learn on this trip is whether or not my quick attachment to Lago di Como was a true attachment, or if it was simply the infatuation of a virgin traveller.  I learned quickly that, while I loved the places I visited in the British Isles, they didn't capture my soul the same way that Italia did.  I remember having very nearly the [same impressions](http://www.bartleby.com/143/12.html) as Oscar Wilde had on arriving.  There's something very different about the land and culture there.\n\nTravel forces you to try new things.  One of my biggest fears as I get older is that I'll stop learning.  The placidity of old age grows rapidly, and otherwise intelligent and curious people drift downward into believing that their experience requires them to always have the right answer.  The opposite is often true: the more questions a person asks, the wiser they tend to be.  Travel helps maintain that inquisitiveness.  It's impossible to travel well and not be brought in front of new experiences in almost blinding sequence.  That's what keeps you coming back.\n\nSo that's it.  Back to my irregularly scheduled wanderings.  I need to travel more.  You probably do too.\n","html":"<p>I have just one last vacation post before I get back to somewhat regularly scheduled programming.  Since my trip I've had a bunch of other topics that have accumulated in sort of half finished form.  Presently they're all about as ambiguous as that last sentence, but hopefully I'll get them finished sooner then later.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And for no particular reason, this blog post is dedicated to Zoe.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For most of my travel recollections, I've tried to focus a lot more on my activities and impressions at specific moments.  The real purpose was to log what I did so I could remember it.  I've mostly avoided any general themes from the entire trip, aside from asides, thinking it would be more valuable to contain them all in one place.  This is that place.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"food\">Food</h4>\n\n<p>When Katie and I grabbed a bagel in the airport in Dublin on our first morning, I think that shop might have been a chain.  Other than that one occasion, I can't remember eating at another chain restaurant.  Anywhere.  The entire time.</p>\n\n<p>That means <em>alot</em>.  Going out and grabbing a quick meal in Europe means a quaint, unique little pub or shop.  In the States, a nice meal out with friends usually means a national chain restaurant of some sort (unless it's a <em>really</em> nice meal out) like a TGI Fridays, Subway, or Ruby Tuesday (or Bennigans or Applebee's or... ).  I've been thinking about this quite a bit since I've been back, because I eat out so much.  We have certain expectations of the prices in a reasonable, everyday restaurant.  A burger should be about 8 dollars.  Pasta dishes are 9-13, salads are 5-8 dollars.  That's quite cheap.  In Europe, the going prices are anywhere from 10-40% higher than that for the same meals.</p>\n\n<p>The problem arises when we try to make an apples to apples comparison - these aren't the same meals.  That lovely pasta with red sauce dish you get in London is made with these things called tomatoes, a remarkable plant that translates quite wonderfully to red sauces.  American chains don't use tomatoes.  They manage to keep their prices even with American expectations by scaling their supply.  So they have suppliers that supply them with mass quantities of crap iceberg lettuce and tomato paste that their chain locations can ingest with a reasonable rate of return.  Meanwhile, the consumer gets their expected $6 caesar salad.  The lack in quality doesn't seem to bother most people, but they're still surprised when they hear that our obesity rates are so much higher than the rest of the Western World.</p>\n\n<p>We have lots of preservatives and other artificial ingredients.  We make our sauces out of pastes or prepackaged nonsense instead of vegetables and other centuries old, basic food products.  We do all of this to keep prices down, but does it affect taste?  If our expectation for super cheap meals anywhere at anytime doesn't correspond to higher quality, do they at least taste the same or better?</p>\n\n<p>Nope.</p>\n\n<p>American food tastes like donkey shit.  Nearly all of it.  It might give you that warm fuzzy feeling on the first bite (you know the one I'm talking about - it's the way that first bite of a big nasty Papa John's pizza tastes), but it doesn't satisfy any desire beyond that, and it certainly doesn't make you feel any better after you finish your meal.</p>\n\n<p>Europeans sacrifice price for quality and taste.  Americans do the opposite.  And it sucks.  And I'm tired of it.  One of my goals over the summer is to actually do something about this in my life.

A Library","slug":"everythings_a_library","markdown":"I seem to alternate between one technical and one (somewhat) non-technical post - excepting travel logs.  That's fine by me.  It provides some harmony and balance to at least one thing I do.  That's important on any task, though usually I fail abysmally.  If I'm working out consistently, I'm giving something else up.  If I'm doing a lot of coding, I'm not seeing much sunlight.  The world runs on trends, so I suppose it makes sense that individuals do the same thing.  Another trend I follow is an introductory paragraph that has nothing to do with anything.  Like this one.\n\nAs another small side note, this is my first post using [TextMate's](http://www.macromates.com) Blogging bundle.  So far, so good.  I started using TextMate about four months ago for all personal development, and I've been really impressed so far.  Great syntax highlighting, great shortcuts, a fabulous bundle system, and absolutely fantastic autocompletion and shortcuts.  If you've got a Mac, you've got to use it.  It's worth the price.\n\nI'm going to be rambling for awhile at a ten thousand foot level on computing and computing machines.  It's necessary so I can figure out what it is I'm trying to say, and I'm sure I'll trip up here and there.  So be prepared for gross generalizations being tossed all over the place.\n\n#### Main()\n\nRecently I've been doing some reading on various programming languages and their various flavors.  This is part of my catch up from an [epic failure](http://icanhascheezburger.com/2007/11/07/epic-fail/) of education.  I've been [doing it wrong](http://icanhascheezburger.com/2007/03/14/youre-doing-it-wrong/). \n\nThere seems to be a general consensus that it's important to use a popular language for a big project (1); more important, in fact, than the language's intrinsic feature set.  That's kind of interesting by itself, since the general consensus is also that choosing a language for a project based on a priori knowledge of the language is shortsighted.  I'm not sure yet how these jive together, but I do agree that the number of developers working with a given language - and thus the libraries, tools and general knowledge available - is important to the quality of a project.\n\nBut what makes a language *popular*?  Or rather, how does a language jump the gap, and move from relative obscurity to fame and fortune on the Internets?  It sometimes seems to happen overnight, but it's always preceded by the release of some interesting project.  So here's a hypothesis: for a language to become popular, hip, and cool, *something important has to be written in that language.*  Let's look at a couple of examples, shall we?\n\n#### C   \n\nGo back into [negative time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) (January 1, 1970) and all operating systems were written in assembly.  Great, big, bad Multics was written in assembly.  Early iterations of Unics were written in assembly.  If you've ever done assembly programming, you'll know that it's a pain in the ass.  Everything sucks.  Imagine trying to think out a sentence, but having to write each letter as a series of dots in the correct pattern, and only being allowed to write one dot per second.  By the time you finished the first letter, you'll have forgotten the purpose of the sentence.  That's assembly.\n\nSo in an effort to make better, easier to read, and more portable code, some of the original Unix guys came up with C as a more expressive alternative to assembly.  It still provided all the low level accesses to a von Neumann architecture that you needed, but without some of the pain.  C pushed Unix.  Unix pushed C.  Their popularity is fundamentally tied together.  Unix was, and still is, C's killer app.\n\n#### Perl\n\nWhat about a very high level language like Perl?  Unix does a lot of plaintext stuff, and awk/sed only get you so far.  So Larry Wall designed Perl to do a lot of simple text processing tasks for Unix.  Plus C has absolutely no real support for Strings (no - chars, pointers, and libraries don't count).  So, without trying too hard, Perl basically took over everything that awk/sed was used for previously, and some other things too.  That was it's first killer app.  When the web began, a lot of people started using Perl for quick processing of CGI stuff.  That was it's second killer app.\n\n#### Java\n\nOk, this one is a bit different.  Java was meant as a handy alternative to C++ without dealing with all the intricacies of compiling on 8,874 varieties of hardware (and other things).  Java as a language seems to still be growing, at a glacial pace, but it's killer app is actually written in C.  The JVM is what really carries along the Java programming language.  As far as I know, the JVM is the first very widespread use of a virtual machine to resolve multiple portability and security issues.  It's a big deal.  And as more and more languages can be run on the JVM (and Microsoft's CLR for that matter), it will be an even bigger deal.  The JVM is Java's killer app.\n\n#### Ruby\n\nRuby is perhaps the most obvious example of one app making a language popular.  Ruby began its life way back in 1993, and it has been a cute little language for a long time.  But nobody ever bothered to pay attention until DHH decided to write a very nice MVC web framework in it.  He called it Ruby on Rails and a star was born.. actually two.  Rails instantly became a success, and people were suddenly scrambling to know Ruby.  Now there's libraries for everything from XMPP to pinning captions on your cat.  Rails is Ruby's killer app.\n\n#### Python\n\nPython is still a bit of an enigma to me.  The most I've done with it, aside from some one liners, is ported a bunch of crap over to Java.  And frankly, I can't think of an answer for Python.  It's got loads of support.  It's got tons of libraries.  People love it.  I have no idea how that happened.  The language must just suck less than others - which means I ought to learn more of it.\n\n#### Lisp\n\nI don't know Lisp yet.  I'm just now trying to learn Scheme.  Lisp was originally a new syntax for computation.  It wasn't even supposed to be a programming language.  Then a grad student wrote an interpreter and wham-o!  Lisp was a language.  For computation.  That makes it entirely different than the other languages I've mentioned thus far.  Their purpose is to execute instructions on a machine.  Lisp's purpose is to compute things.  Because of that, it's probably the most fundamental, universal language we have.  The [lambda calculus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_Calculus) is Lisp's killer app. (Can't you just feel the metaphor stretching?)\n\n#### Ad Nauseum\n\nThis could go on..  It's important to use a popular language when working on a project.  Obscure languages must be used (or be acknowledged as useful) to write something important for them to become popular (2).  So why would anyone bother then?  Pretty much everything, including the kitchen sink, is [Turing-equivalent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing-complete), so why not just use a common, well-known language?\n\n#### Syntactic Sugar\n\nLet's consider one of the useful goodies of Perl (inherited from sed, I think).  Regular expressions are remarkably convenient little structures that let us say all sorts of things.  Finding a given pattern inside a string isn't a difficult problem, and it could be done in any language.  But let's say I'm doing it a lot, and the patterns change.  Instead of writing various chunks of code for each situation, it would be a much more elegant solution to come up with a single construct, and plug in the individual expressions there.  I'd want to write a library for it.  That's essentially what regular expressions are.  They're native to Perl, and more or less in other languages, so now they're considered a pretty standard language feature.  But back in the day it was quite a novelty - it was the coding equivalent of one of those giant 3 foot long Pixie sticks you used to down as a ten year old.  Time has changed it from syntactic sugar to a standard language feature.\n\nWe can make the same case for even more basic language constructs, like loops.  \nRuby lets me write\n\n\t(1..100).each {|i| ..}  \n\t\nC let's me write\n\n\tfor (int i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {...}\n\t\nLisps use tail recursion.  But what does any of that matter when I can simply store a number in a register, perform some set of operations, and then iterate the register manually, and check the register manually?  God help me, but if I had to do that, I'd want to write a library for it.\n\n#### Power\n\nAll languages provide varying degrees of syntactic sugar for a von Neumann architecture, which is to say, for a simple, cheap hardware implementation of a Turing Machine.  A lot of sugar is very useful.  Some can be worthless.\n\nThe syntax, the sugar, for writing on this architecture is the only thing that really varies.  We call into various syntaxes to accomplish the tasks we require, and they get executed on a Turing-equivalent machine.  A Turing machine wants lots of 1s and 0s in a certain order to denote instructions and data.  Anything on top of that is just a useful library for writing in the Turing machine's language.\n\nThat sounds goofy.  If you're sane you probably think I'm nuts.  So let's look at an example of power and see if we can't see some differences between language abstractions and syntaxes, libraries, and the sugar.\n\nHere's problem 20 from Project Euler:\n\n\t\tn! means n * (n - 1) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1\n\n\t\tFind the sum of the digits in the number 100!\n\t\t\n\nRelatively simple, but requires a little bit of work.  Certainly not something you'd want to compute by hand, or by calculator.

32 bits (or 64 smartass..)!  So what do we do?\n\nHere's some solutions in a couple of languages.\n\nJava:\n\n<script src=\"http://gist.github.com/38241.js\">doink</script>\n\nThat's a little bit long (30 lines), and I had to use the BigInteger class for arbitrarily long integers.  Note I didn't use any particularly exciting Java language features either.  I could've made the loops shorter and other neat things.  Whatever, it's a quick and dirty.  Deal with it.\n\nHere's the same thing in Ruby:\n\n<script src=\"http://gist.github.com/38242.js\">hmm</script>\n\nWow!  1 Line!  But what's all this inject and |foo| nonsense?  How are we dealing with any variables in here?\n\nHere's one more solution I pulled from the Project Euler forums, courtesy of nsg.  This is about as terse as I think you can get.  The J Language is known for that sort of thing:\n\n\t+/\".\"0\":!100x\n\t\n\nYes, that really is the whole thing.  13 characters.\n\nJava code first, since there's clearly more of it.  Those imports, they're arguably language features, but they really just call into Java's vast libraries.  Class and method declarations are certainly part of the language.  Semicolons are part of the language.  Since there's no overloading, we should call the primitive operators a part of the language syntax.  Even the actual multiplication is being handed off to the BigInteger class.  The syntax itself is pretty barren.  There's not much beyond object oriented structures, conditionals, loops, and operators.\n\nI won't comment on J except to say \"Damn\".  Ruby is pretty sparse too.  The loop is passed off to a Range object, which calls the inject method.  Both inject methods take a block and execute it - library calls, with subtleties handling the blocks.  The operators are really methods.  1+2 is equivalent to 1.+2.  The rest is more obviously just method calls on objects.\n\nOr is it?  Ruby is built completely from the ground up on the object oriented paradigm, so how do we separate the two?  Everything is an object.  Everything is part of the API.  Are we just playing at semantics, or is there really a difference between the language abstractions and syntax and a set of libraries?  Is there ever really a difference?\n\nOne of the glorious things about Ruby for me (coming from Java and, earlier, C) is that the syntax of the language sort of melts away.  I don't have to worry about semicolons, but I can use them if it makes me comfortable.  I don't have to worry about 32 bits for ints.  The Integer class has two subclasses, Fixnum and Bignum, which handle numbers smaller and larger than 31 bits respectively.  Ruby casts between the two types for you, so you don't have to worry about it.  Now *that* is a language feature.\n\nIt also naturally abstracts away some of the variables for me.  I don't need to worry too much about totaling my factorial function because I can toss blocks around that will accomplish the same thing for me.  That's really nice.  It's the sort of thing I'd expect a library to do - streamline a set of operations to make it near trivial to accomplish.\n\nTaking the limit: having no syntax is the best syntax.  The Lisps seem to want to get as close to that as possible.  They have certain language abstractions (car and cdr, operators), but I've only ever seen two characters of syntax in Lisp: ( and ).  Maybe I have seen the occasional \\` or , in there as well.  That's still very terse.\n\nI think this is what most people really mean when they talk about the power of a language.  It's terse.  Some of the demigods on stilts whose blogs we read may be considering some of the outstanding metaprogramming and macro abstractions of a language when talking about power, but we mere mortals generally mean it on a simpler level.  Power equates to a language being terse.  If I can write 10 lines in language A to do the work of 50 lines in language B, I'll generally consider language A more powerful.\n\nThis breaks down for practical reasons.  Humans want to have things like maintainability and readability.  They don't want to spend 10 minutes to understand 13 characters of J.  It may be elegant to write, but it's not elegant to grok.  Humans seem to like the decimal number system too.  It's comfortable and it maps well to our anatomy.  Machines like binary as a reasonable and efficient number system for recording information.  We could use unary though.  It would suck.  33 in binary is 100001.  33 in unary is 111111111111111111111111111111111 (or pick your arbitrary character of choice).  You can see where this is going.\n\nThere's lots of esoteric programming languages that push it too far as well.  Brainfuck is a good example.  What a name for a programming language huh?  Brainfuck.  I'd like to propose we use Brainfuck for this implementation of your problem.  Hey, have you done any brainfuck lately?  Let's work on this brainfuck code here.  Great name.\n\nAnyway, brainfuck was an attempt to have as few operations as possible.  It has a compiler that fits into 200 bytes.  It has only eight operators and none of them take any arguments.  And it's Turing Complete.  [LOLCode](http://www.lolcode.com) has been proven Turing Complete too.\n\n#### von Neumann\n\n\"We have reached the limits of what is possible with computers.\"\nJohn Von Neumann, 1949\n\nI've heard that quote a few times before, mostly amidst a bunch of other technology quotes that make us laugh at those old feebleminded geniuses and their sightlessness.  I'm sure you've heard the one from the president of IBM, talking about the world market for computers being limited to a total of four?\n\nYeah, these two quotes have nothing to do with each other.  One is shortsighted, one is not.\n\nThe really interesting bit about that von Neumann quote is that he was right.  By the 1940s, the limits of what is and is not computable had been hypothesized under at least 3 different types of abstraction: [Turing machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) (the most famous, perhaps), the Lambda Calculus, and recursion.  All three are [equivalent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church-Turing_thesis).  ENIAC was Turing-equivalent in 1946.\n\nENIAC couldn't do anything that we do regularly today.  Heck, my computer in college couldn't handle the photo processing I do regularly now.\n\nSo let's back up a second.  Turing Machines, lambda functions or any other mode of computation make no accommodation for time/space complexity.  Turing's original notion of a Turing Machine included an infinite tape for input.  There's never a concession for when a program will halt, only that it may halt.  Turing machines are also difficult to use to model certain common computer tasks that require lots of input, like word processing.  Lastly, modern computers are Turing-equivalent, but they're hampered by all of the state limitations of the implementation.  In other words, if I have a von Neumann architecture (like we all do), I'm limited by each of it's parts: CPU, memory, disk, bus, etc.  So I'll always be able to \"do more\" as time presses on and the limitations on the finite space of a machine become less severe (3).  But give me enough vacuum tubes and a couple million years and I'll get ENIAC to compute a Mersenne prime for you.\n\n#### The Abstraction Tree\n\nThe foundations of computability are very well known (4).  A bunch of reasonable and cheap hardware architectures have been built to model this computation.  On top of those architectures have been built a set of very simple languages (syntaxes) to manipulate the state of the hardware.  Those languages are still too difficult for humans to manipulate with any advanced meaning, so another set of abstracted language constructs got built on top of those.  This gets us to assembly and C, which is the underlying basis for a lot of other abstractions, including things like the JVM, the CLR and a lot of the Ruby \"language\" (library).  On top of assembly and C, both of which are great for manipulating a Turing-equivalent von Neumann architecture, we can make all sorts of abstractions and families of syntaxes for easily describing any number of problems.  We can build parsers, compilers, or interpreters for everything from markup to duck typing to brainfuck.  The limitations at this level of abstraction are the ones known to us: hardware speed and capacity, syntax obfuscation, and our own stupidity.\n\nThe further up the abstraction tree we move, assuming we pick the proper tool, which is no mean feat, the simpler it should be to fit our problem to the abstraction.  It makes me wonder what set of abstractions, if any, are in our future.  Are there any layers that we haven't reached yet, or are we simply building the different types of tools that each different job requires?  DSLs are gaining popularity for certain types of tasks, and it even seems like the newer, hip languages are just new combinations and subsets of older languages.  Are we really gaining anything new?  Or are we simply building tools and libraries to fill in the holes?\n\nSo pick your poison.  I mean syntax.  No, I mean poison.  Everything's a library.  The language is computation!\n\n(1)  The value of big can vary, let's set the bar low and say anything over 10,000 lines.\n\n(2)  This won't necessarily make it popular though.  Apple writes all their tasty bits in Objective-C, and that isn't exactly booming in popularity.\n\n(3) Cloud computing will make this extremely interesting.  It's bursting the seams of what computations are possible.  Some things are still difficult.  But some computations are [embarassingly parallel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarassingly_parallel), and many others at least manageable.  Flinging nearly endless machines at the problem allows computations over vast datasets.\n\n(4) Although not completely well known.  There are still open questions like [P = NP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_%3D_NP_problem) and quantum cmputing which could totally change the types of computations possible.\n","html":"<p>I seem to alternate between one technical and one (somewhat) non-technical post - excepting travel logs.  That's fine by me.  It provides some harmony and balance to at least one thing I do.  That's important on any task, though usually I fail abysmally.  If I'm working out consistently, I'm giving something else up.  If I'm doing a lot of coding, I'm not seeing much sunlight.  The world runs on trends, so I suppose it makes sense that individuals do the same thing.  Another trend I follow is an introductory paragraph that has nothing to do with anything.  Like this one.</p>\n\n<p>As another small side note, this is my first post using <a href=\"http://www.macromates.com\">TextMate's</a> Blogging bundle.  So far, so good.  I started using TextMate about four months ago for all personal development, and I've been really impressed so far.  Great syntax highlighting, great shortcuts, a fabulous bundle system, and absolutely fantastic autocompletion and shortcuts.  If you've got a Mac, you've got to use it.  It's worth the price.</p>\n\n<p>I'm going to be rambling for awhile at a ten thousand foot level on computing and computing machines.  It's necessary so I can figure out what it is I'm trying to say, and I'm sure I'll trip up here and there.  So be prepared for gross generalizations being tossed all over the place.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"main\">Main()</h4>\n\n<p>Recently I've been doing some reading on various programming languages and their various flavors.  This is part of my catch up from an <a href=\"http://icanhascheezburger.com/2007/11/07/epic-fail/\">epic failure</a> of education.  I've been <a href=\"http://icanhascheezburger.com/2007/03/14/youre-doing-it-wrong/\">doing it wrong</a>. </p>\n\n<p>There seems to be a general consensus that it's important to use a popular language for a big project (1); more important, in fact, than the language's intrinsic feature set.  That's kind of interesting by itself, since the general consensus is also that choosing a language for a project based on a priori knowledge of the language is shortsighted.  I'm not sure yet how these jive together, but I do agree that the number of developers working with a given language - and thus the libraries, tools and general knowledge available - is important to the quality of a project.</p>\n\n<p>But what makes a language <em>popular</em>?  Or rather, how does a language jump the gap, and move from relative obscurity to fame and fortune on the Internets?  It sometimes seems to happen overnight, but it's always preceded by the release of some interesting project.  So here's a hypothesis: for a language to become popular, hip, and cool, <em>something important has to be written in that language.</em>  Let's look at a couple of examples, shall we?</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"c\">C</h4>\n\n<p>Go back into <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time\">negative time</a> (January 1, 1970) and all operating systems were written in assembly.  Great, big, bad Multics was written in assembly.  Early iterations of Unics were written in assembly.  If you've ever done assembly programming, you'll know that it's a pain in the ass.  Everything sucks.  Imagine trying to think out a sentence, but having to write each letter as a series of dots in the correct pattern, and only being allowed to write one dot per second.  By the time you finished the first letter, you'll have forgotten the purpose of the sentence.  That's assembly.</p>\n\n<p>So in an effort to make better, easier to read, and more portable code, some of the original Unix guys came up with C as a more expressive alternative to assembly.  It still provided all the low level accesses to a von Neumann architecture that you needed, but without some of the pain.  C pushed Unix.  Unix pushed C.  Their popularity is fundamentally tied together.  Unix was, and still is, C's killer app.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"perl\">Perl</h4>\n\n<p>What about a very high level language like Perl?  Unix does a lot of plaintext stuff, and awk/sed only get you so far.  So Larry Wall designed Perl to do a lot of simple text processing tasks for Unix.  Plus C has absolutely no real support for Strings (no - chars, pointers, and libraries don't count).  So, without trying too hard, Perl basically took over everything that awk/sed was used for previously, and some other things too.  That was it's first killer app.  When the web began, a lot of people started using Perl for quick processing of CGI stuff.  That was it's second killer app.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"java\">Java</h4>\n\n<p>Ok, this one is a bit different.  Java was meant as a handy alternative to C++ without dealing with all the intricacies of compiling on 8,874 varieties of hardware (and other things).  Java as a language seems to still be growing, at a glacial pace, but it's killer app is actually written in C.  The JVM is what really carries along the Java programming language.  As far as I know, the JVM is the first very widespread use of a virtual machine to resolve multiple portability and security issues.  It's a big deal.  And as more and more languages can be run on the JVM (and Microsoft's CLR for that matter), it will be an even bigger deal.  The JVM is Java's killer app.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"ruby\">Ruby</h4>\n\n<p>Ruby is perhaps the most obvious example of one app making a language popular.  Ruby began its life way back in 1993, and it has been a cute little language for a long time.  But nobody ever bothered to pay attention until DHH decided to write a very nice MVC web framework in it.  He called it Ruby on Rails and a star was born.. actually two.  Rails instantly became a success, and people were suddenly scrambling to know Ruby.  Now there's libraries for everything from XMPP to pinning captions on your cat.  Rails is Ruby's killer app.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"python\">Python</h4>\n\n<p>Python is still a bit of an enigma to me.  The most I've done with it, aside from some one liners, is ported a bunch of crap over to Java.  And frankly, I can't think of an answer for Python.  It's got loads of support.  It's got tons of libraries.  People love it.  I have no idea how that happened.  The language must just suck less than others - which means I ought to learn more of it.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"lisp\">Lisp</h4>\n\n<p>I don't know Lisp yet.  I'm just now trying to learn Scheme.  Lisp was originally a new syntax for computation.  It wasn't even supposed to be a programming language.  Then a grad student wrote an interpreter and wham-o!  Lisp was a language.  For computation.  That makes it entirely different than the other languages I've mentioned thus far.  Their purpose is to execute instructions on a machine.  Lisp's purpose is to compute things.  Because of that, it's probably the most fundamental, universal language we have.  The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_Calculus\">lambda calculus</a> is Lisp's killer app. (Can't you just feel the metaphor stretching?)</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"adnauseum\">Ad Nauseum</h4>\n\n<p>This could go on..  It's important to use a popular language when working on a project.  Obscure languages must be used (or be acknowledged as useful) to write something important for them to become popular (2).  So why would anyone bother then?  Pretty much everything, including the kitchen sink, is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing-complete\">Turing-equivalent</a>, so why not just use a common, well-known language?</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"syntacticsugar\">Syntactic Sugar</h4>\n\n<p>Let's consider one of the useful goodies of Perl (inherited from sed, I think).  Regular expressions are remarkably convenient little structures that let us say all sorts of things.  Finding a given pattern inside a string isn't a difficult problem, and it could be done in any language.  But let's say I'm doing it a lot, and the patterns change.  Instead of writing various chunks of code for each situation, it would be a much more elegant solution to come up with a single construct, and plug in the individual expressions there.  I'd want to write a library for it.  That's essentially what regular expressions are.  They're native to Perl, and more or less in other languages, so now they're considered a pretty standard language feature.  But back in the day it was quite a novelty - it was the coding equivalent of one of those giant 3 foot long Pixie sticks you used to down as a ten year old.  Time has changed it from syntactic sugar to a standard language feature.</p>\n\n<p>We can make the same case for even more basic language constructs, like loops. <br />\nRuby lets me write</p>\n\n<pre><code>(1..100).each {|i| ..}  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>C let's me write</p>\n\n<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 100; i++) {...}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Lisps use tail recursion.  But what does any of that matter when I can simply store a number in a register, perform some set of operations, and then iterate the register manually, and check the register manually?  God help me, but if I had to do that, I'd want to write a library for it.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"power\">Power</h4>\n\n<p>All languages provide varying degrees of syntactic sugar for a von Neumann architecture, which is to say, for a simple, cheap hardware implementation of a Turing Machine.  A lot of sugar is very useful.  Some can be worthless.</p>\n\n<p>The syntax, the sugar, for writing on this architecture is the only thing that really varies.  We call into various syntaxes to accomplish the tasks we require, and they get executed on a Turing-equivalent machine.  A Turing machine wants lots of 1s and 0s in a certain order to denote instructions and data.  Anything on top of that is just a useful library for writing in the Turing machine's language.</p>\n\n<p>That sounds goofy.  If you're sane you probably think I'm nuts.  So let's look at an example of power and see if we can't see some differences between language abstractions and syntaxes, libraries, and the sugar.</p>\n\n<p>Here's problem 20 from Project Euler:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    n! means n * (n - 1) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1\n\n    Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Relatively simple, but requires a little bit of work.  Certainly not something you'd want to compute by hand, or by calculator. <br />\n100! is 93326215443944152681699238856266700490715968264381621468592963895217599993229915608941463976156518286253697920827223758251185210916864000000000000000000000000.  </p>\n\n<p>I don't think it fits in 32

proper tool, which is no mean feat, the simpler it should be to fit our problem to the abstraction.  It makes me wonder what set of abstractions, if any, are in our future.  Are there any layers that we haven't reached yet, or are we simply building the different types of tools that each different job requires?  DSLs are gaining popularity for certain types of tasks, and it even seems like the newer, hip languages are just new combinations and subsets of older languages.  Are we really gaining anything new?  Or are we simply building tools and libraries to fill in the holes?</p>\n\n<p>So pick your poison.  I mean syntax.  No, I mean poison.  Everything's a library.  The language is computation!</p>\n\n<p>(1)  The value of big can vary, let's set the bar low and say anything over 10,000 lines.</p>\n\n<p>(2)  This won't necessarily make it popular though.  Apple writes all their tasty bits in Objective-C, and that isn't exactly booming in popularity.</p>\n\n<p>(3) Cloud

vast datasets.</p>\n\n<p>(4) Although not completely well known.  There are still open questions like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_%3D_NP_problem\">P = NP</a> and quantum cmputing which

Recent Missteps","slug":"apples_recent_missteps","markdown":"Apple is known for its exceedingly well planned and executed products.  They charge a premium for them and they've built a fiercely loyal customer base because of the quality level.  Mac computers are simply the best computers available, iPods are the best music players, and the iPhone is the best phone - all by a wide margin.  But they've started blundering ever so slightly.  Not enough to destroy any of the religiosity surrounding them just yet, but they need to pick their pace back up to its normal level.\n\nHere's a brief enumeration of what's gone wrong:\n\n#### 3G and AT&T\n\nThe iPhone 3G requires activation in the Apple Store unless you ordered it.  Picking up an activated phone isn't so bad, but store activation is a hideous idea.  The activation process for my 4 GB iPhone was completely painless.  It gave me a great first impression of the iPhone and it actually endeared me to AT&T as well - and I never thought I'd have any respect for a cell carrier.  The original iPhone was purchased in an Apple store.  Then you brought it home, hooked it up to a computer with iTunes, and took care of all the AT&T plan setup online.  There were no long lines and you didn't have to deal with any commission-based sales idiot convincing you to get the more expensive plan.  It was simple, elegant, and endearing in a world full of technology with horrible customer interfaces.\n\nThe 3G activation process is a pre-planned bottleneck through which all new and returning customers must pass.  Doing it in the store adds interaction with people, possibilities for delays based on connectivity, people, and hardware, and longer lines based on the number of employees handling 3G sales.  \n\nWho ever thought this was a good idea?  \n\nAT&T of course.  See, lots of people purchased the original iPhone as a delightful little piece of commodity hardware, brought them home (or sold them), and never activated them with AT&T.  They used them on other networks or sold them overseas.  So AT&T is losing sales and probably blaming Apple's process for the loss (not to mention Apple customers).  So they plotted this delightful little program where all new phones are activated in the stores, thus bolstering their profits and theoretically making happy shareholders.\n\nHere's why this scheme is a bad idea for both Apple and AT&T.  Apple has never, ever (at least since Steve Jobs has been back) compromised on the quality or elegance of anything about their products.  Now they have.  An exclusive corporate partnership with a cell carrier sort of requires the occasional compromise, and this is probably only the first example.\n\nYou know all those stupid little stickers you get on PC hardware that say \"Vista Compatible\" or \"Windows Certified\"?  Yeah, they're stupid, so people put them on toilets and other fun things.  Microsoft has huge resources at work ensuring that hardware vendors produce hardware that will be beefy enough to work with their products.  It's sort of a natural continuation of the market forces that drove Microsoft to be such a behemoth in the first place.  And being the major software player in the PC industry, Microsoft wants to make sure that their software doesn't run slow.  Most users aren't going to know that a piece of hardware is causing their problems, they'll just blame it on the software.  The process breaks down quickly; hardware vendors take the minimum requirements, build with the cheapest components possible, and push commodity pieces out the door.  It makes me wonder how many Microsoft products really aren't that bad if they only had a decent machine to run on.  It doesn't take much to see that a lot of their usability sucks, but there are still some bright people that work there and they crank out some interesting stuff.\n\nAnyway, Apple has always taken the opposite approach in the market.  They rigorously maintain both software and hardware for all their systems.  You can't get OS X for anything but a Mac computer.  They use all the best hardware.  Their screens are famous for color representation.  The laptop keyboards have a light sensor and illuminated keys so you can see at night.  The cases are made out of aluminum for crying out loud.  Macs are just beautiful, elegant machines and Apple ensures that they all have the chops to run any of their software products.  It makes for a seamless environment with very few holes.  They push elegance through the whole company.  The buying experience, whether online or at a store, is better than competitors.  Even the packaging that the products *come in* is better thought out than some products.  Their packaging department must have one hell of an origami collection in their workspace.\n\nApple has never had to compromise on the package they provide to their customers.  And their customers are fiercely loyal because of it.  Demented, even.  The company's success is derived straight from that loyalty.  Apple customers buy more Apple products.  They don't buy other stuff.  They talk about the products.  They create buzz.  They tell their friends.  Apple has taken computing and made it elegant and cool.  The quintessential image of a hacker, artist, photographer, and college student all now involve a Mac laptop.\n\nNow they need to fulfill agreements with a corporate entity larger than themselves and on whom they depend for making their products viable (since a phone without phone service sort of defeats the purpose).  AT&T isn't as hip and cool as Apple.  Their network infrastructure is seen as second rate and their customer service is nearly as maddening as other unnamed larger carriers.  AT&T sticks with the consistent corporate view that sales are what matters, not customer satisfaction.  \n\nSo Apple and AT&T have compromised and ensured that every 3G iPhone purchased comes with an AT&T plan by activating it in the store.  This is *not a dealbreaker*.  But making the experience ornery in any way for customers is a misstep for Apple.  They live on buzz, and if their customer loyalty starts to disintegrate they will lose the tremendous edge they have in the marketplace.  \n\nIt's a misstep for AT&T too.  By teaming with Apple they've gotten a chance to capitalize on some of that buzz and bring it into the cellular service arena.  Imagine a cell carrier with fierce customer loyalty.  I know, it's hard.  But imagine a humane and comfortable customer service system, a network with great coverage, 3G service with consistent fast speeds, and reasonably priced (dare I say included) SMS plans.  Gosh, if something like that existed, I'd be hyping it everywhere.  You would too.  We'd tell all of our friends and they'd all be switching.  The business would be growing by spades (rather than growing solely on an exclusive hardware agreement), infrastructure would be growing, and there would be some great long term projections.\n\nInstead, in an effort to bolster short term sales numbering strictly in the hundreds of thousands (if that), we get a poor introduction to the service created by a bottleneck in activations.  It reeks of desperation for every last penny they can squeeze out of us.  It kills the buzz - in my mind the only reason I'm going to use AT&T is because I'm forced to.\n\nAT&T is missing a big opportunity and Apple is diminishing its customer zealotry.\n\n#### iPhone 2.0\n\nTo be fair to Apple, that first one isn't really their fault.  But I can't see how this one is anything but.\n\nApple customers are pampered.  We're used to our cozy little spaces where nothing goes wrong, every software update is flawless, and every product feature works exactly as advertised, if not better.  When the iPhone came out, everybody rushed out to see if it worked in person as well as it seemed to in Steve Job's introductory keynote.  Amazingly, it did.  It had tactile feedback and responded instantly to what you wanted.  If you hit the lock button, the screen turned off immediately and you heard a little \"click\".\n\nJoel talks a lot about that sort of feedback in [Hitting the High Notes](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/HighNotes.html).  He goes on and on (as he should) about how the little design decisions made for the iPod resulted in a great product that customers really enjoyed using.  \n\nIt seems as if the new 2.0 software has lost that.  Here's a [list from DHH](http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1148-iphone-20-the-glory-wore-off-in-wash), as an example:\n\n\"Here are just a few of the griefs I’ve felt:\n\n* Annoying delays all over the place.\n* Changing to the SMS view can take more than 10 seconds at times.\n* Transitions between apps are being dropped entirely or cut short (the latter looks like a UI stutter).\n* It some times requires 3 clicks on the fast-forward button in iTunes to get a response.\n* The screen will freeze for 4-5 seconds not accepting any input, then replay ALL your feverous tapping when it finally returns.\n* Some times the keyboard will not keep up with your input (and I’m not that fast of a typer).\n* I’ve had applications crash numerous times.\n* The entire phone has crashed twice.\n* Restarting the phone kinda helps some of these problems, but not for long and it feels so dirty and Windows-like to do.\"\n\t\t\nIf 1.0 was so great, why is 2.0 such a big step backwards?  Just like everyone else, I went and got a bunch of apps as soon as I downloaded the 2.0 software.  The problems started immediately, followed quickly by cursing and gnashing of teeth.  The worst, in my mind, is that when I lock the phone, it sometimes takes *several seconds* for the screen to shut off and hear the click.  *I don't feel in control anymore.*  That makes me feel uncomfortable, and literally overnight my iPhone has gone from devoted daily use to halting use only when I need it.  Without the great user experience, the same emotional appeal isn't there.  (A side benefit may be that my friends don't all have to listen to my unending rants about Apple's greatness.)  \n\nNow I've taken all the apps back off the phone, except for Twitterific, in the hopes of staving off the slowness.  It's still there.  Scrolling is choppy and ugly.  Typing is slow.  The whole UI is just a shade away from perfection, but without that quick interaction, it's just another phone.\n\nIt's ironic that the keynote introducing the new phone and software spent so much time describing Apple's new Push service.  They went on and on about how other phone OS's use hidden processes and process managers and other crap to maintain connections for apps.  I really have no idea if the 2.0 changes are caused by opening the OS up to allow all these other apps to run.  If that's the reason, the apps just aren't that important.  Or at least I'll wait to use them for the hopefully stable 2.1 release.  But I shouldn't have to do that, which leads me to my final gripe.\n\n#### Release Dates\n\nThe whole computer industry, by and large, is still pushed by dates.  We all get to read about the hip, cool ways some companies work, but in the day to day software world, the deadline still reigns supreme.  I think Apple is past the more foolish, historical reasons for dates.  Most people in the software world understand now that dates ought to be soft if you're going to get the best product.  Adobe seems to do this.  I'm waiting desperately right now for LightRoom 2.0 to be released.  I'm running the beta version and I love it.  Adobe refuses to release a date for a software release.  One day, it will just be released.  I'm content to wait, knowing that when I purchase LightRoom it will be \"complete\", and I won't have to deal with any nagging bugs the team didn't have time to track down before their deadline.\n\nBut Apple's buzz has started causing such a stir that they're almost shackling themselves back to a date system.  It would almost seem a travesty now if some big, cool new product wasn't released at WWDC or MacWorld.  Steve's keynotes have become legendary, and we've seen hit after hit introduced in the same way.  I worry now that catering to the buzz has produced a new artificial deadline to push products to ensure the buzz continues.  \n\nThis year, the iPhone 3G and 2.0 software were announced at WWDC.  Half of me wonders if the software was even done.  Obviously the 3G may need some lead time for production, but why not release the software immediately?  If it isn't done, wait until it is.  Or make sure your date is realistic.  The buzz only works if the product is worth the wait.  A big new version shouldn't be a buggy, interim release.  It should be a solid, mature system already, *especially* when they started with such a seemingly stable 1.0 version.\n\nAnother example: in the last two weeks, my MacBook Pro has frozen 3 times.  It's never frozen before.  None of my Macs ever have.  I didn't even know the option-apple-esc sequence to kill a process, I just always used the command line.  Having to reboot suddenly sucks, and it has made me weary of OS X updates in the same way as I've become weary of iPhone software updates.  I'll wait now until some friends try them, and then see if there are any problems.\n\nIt's not lost on me that there are rumors circulating that Steve Jobs may have some health problems.  If he does, I wish him all the best.  He's done a lot for the industry.  There are also longstanding rumors of an amazingly tight grip on quality and vision from the top down at Apple.  If both of those rumors are true, it makes me wonder just how much influence the top brass had on their most recent product releases.  I can't imagine a company of Apple's stature still being so tied to one man's control that it would falter even a little without his watchful eye, but it is an interesting situation to consider.  If Steve Job's were to retire, for instance, how would the direction of Apple's offerings change?\n\nApple makes the best computing products available today.  I still spout off regularly to all my friends about how they need to have Mac computers to be productive.  But the religious gleam in my eye has dwindled.  The zealotry of many of the Apple customers I know is fading ever so slightly.  All of their major products are still the best things going today.  But keeping that edge is going to be more and more vital as they continue to gain market share.  If they expect to maintain their momentum, they've got to make sure they keep treating their customers like humans they care about, rather than like a chance to extract dollars.\n\nI hope they keep doing it right.\n","html":"<p>Apple is known for its exceedingly well planned and executed products.

If they expect to maintain their momentum, they've got to make sure they keep treating their customers like humans they care about, rather than like a chance to extract dollars.</p>\n\n<p>I hope they keep doing it right.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"de_DE","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2008-07-27T03:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2008-07-27T03:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2008-07-27T03:00:00.000Z","published_by":1,"visibility":"public","mobiledoc":null,"amp":null},{"id":25,"uuid":"ca37fbad-1a58-41ea-9f0a-ee0bc9f9a15d","title":"An Automated Method For Making Your Writing Suck Less","slug":"an_automated_method_for_making_your_writing_suck_less","markdown":"#### Inspiration\n\nLast night I was on a roll.  I had all these thoughts going through my head.  I had the main bits down for how to improve my method of writing and I was going through it point by point.  I had viable arguments and even specific sentence structures all setup and ready to go.  The thoughts were flowing like drainage off my overwatered garden.\n\nI was in bed the whole time.  I didn't get up.  *I didn't write anything.*  That was a huge mistake.\n\nThe whole time I was laying there, a secondary process was firing events constantly saying \"you should get up, go downstairs, and start typing\".  A monumental amount of pure, distilled laziness kept throwing all these events on the ground.  Now, that laziness has sublimated directly into frustration.\n\nAnytime you're struck by some inspiration, no matter how miniscule or irrelevant it may seem, **don't ignore it**!  If you're free (and laying in bed counts as free time), then get your lazy ass up and start putting the proverbial pen into the digital inkpot.  I wonder how many opportunities for interesting thoughts are lost simply because those secondary events that tell you to actually *write* and not just *think* get dropped.  Too often for me.  This is one of the hardest parts of writing: actually doing it.\n\nFrom now on, I will be working in a much more focused manner on letting those inspirational moments turn into effort.  It's a matter of getting out of one's own way and turning thoughts into words on a page.  Don't expect your words to be a final, immaculate thought.  Just get out a working first version.  \n\n#### Way Hard\n\nWriting is hard.  Really hard.  Harder than programming.  Harder than most of the math I've done.  It's harder than building an architecture, or understanding algorithmic complexity, or remembering grammars for regular expressions.\n\nYou followin' me?  This stuff is way hard.  That's why I keep trying to toss out reasonable sized blog posts that are actually coherent.  I go over these things way more than their subject matter might suggest.  To you, these are just some guy's opinions about random subjects.  To me, they're a vehicle for better understanding how to put thoughts - perhaps the most powerful substance known to man - out into the world.  Anybody that cares at all about thinking well, by necessity must also care about writing.\n\nI had all these wonderful, perhaps even eloquent things to say about this last night.  That's why I'm so pissed right now.  I didn't write any of them down, even as a checkpoint to remember where my thought process stalled.  If it's so hard, I should be giving myself every opportunity to make it easier.  \n\nHopefully I can recap a few of the things I was thinking about.\n\nThe thing that makes writing so hard is that the set of rules for \"good\" writing is completely fluid.  They're not concrete, and the best, most transcendental writing usually breaks them anyway.  One of the most joyful things about programming is that there's always some axiom, rule, or concept to fall back on.  It's still creative, and the possibility for elegant solutions exists, but the elegance of a solution is often defined by how fundamental or generic it can be.  Elegance always passes through axiomatic simplicity at some point.\n\nWriting has no such strictures.  It can be simple and profound, or complex, ornate, and ostentatious and still achieve the effect that the writer is hoping for.  Take a look at some of the works of [Theodore Roethke](http://gawow.com/roethke/poems/18.html), [Kurt Vonnegut](http://instruct.westvalley.edu/lafave/hb.html), [William Carlos Williams](http://www.theotherpages.org/poems/william1.html#9), or [Langson Hughes](http://www.cswnet.com/~menamc/langston.htm).  These guys used language to induce profound reactions in their readers.  They can toy with you, knowing just how well they're setting you up for some grand anticlimax.  They can make you laugh, cry, or breath a deep sigh of relief.  They can make you yearn wistfully for a better life unfound even where you think it hides, or they can make you revolt against false powers bent on your slavery.  I'm moved nearly every time I read anything they have written.\n\nThe alphabet, syntaxes, and grammars that parse writing are infinitely more complex than those that parse a program.  Without guidelines, it's difficult to come up with statistical analyses of a piece of text that could offer an area of improvement to the writer.  Perhaps there are still some rudimentary tests though.\n\n#### Wordles and Arcs\n\nI was looking at an article on document and text visualization the other day and a couple of the visualizations struck me as interesting.  Being the introspective person that I am (or narcissistic prig if you prefer), I tried applying two types of analysis to my own blog.\n\nHere are the results:\n\n[Wordle](http://wordle.net/):\n![Wordcloud](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhyrr/mhyrr.github.com/master/images/wordcloud.png)\n\n[Phrase Arcs](http://www.neoformix.com/Projects/DocumentArcDiagrams/index.html):\n![Phrase Arc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhyrr/mhyrr.github.com/master/images/phrasearcs.png)\n\nLet's start with the Wordle, which is comprised of only my last five posts.  Wordle filters out very common English words like \"the\" and \"of\" and then produces a cloud of the most common words (250 of them in this case) with size representing relative number of occurences.  \n\nDid you notice anything looking at it?  Most of the bigger words make sense: \"language\" - yeah I had a whole post talking about that, \"Apple\" - yeah that too, \"Ruby\" - that makes sense.  What about \"just\", \"like\", and \"really\"?  Those seem reall--(crap).. those seem suspicious.\n\nI went through my previous posts to see how I used those three words.  The short, shy answer is: I overused them or used them poorly.\n\nLet's assume for a moment that you are an astute reader interested in what I, the author, have to say - a pleasant fiction for me.  If you are interested in what I'm saying, then the best thing I can do is say it as simply and elegantly as possible.  My primary aim is to take my thoughts and translate them to your brain coherently.  If I'm watering down my thoughts with middling language, I'm downshifting them into a less forceful thought, and that's *just really* not exactly *like* the original thought.  See?   \n\nI'll say it another way.  Relativism being one of the primary misguided modes of thought in our time, I want to counteract it as much as I can.  That means saying exactly what I think in a manner with which you will understand it, if not agree with it.  That's *why* I think my thoughts could be relevant to someone reading what I write.  I believe that there are certain universal truths that exist, and I want to be able to give voice to the ways in which I try to understand more about them.\n\nTaking a statistical look at the words I've been using makes me realize that I'm still watering things down.  I'm taking the easy way out and suggesting that one thing is *like* another.  I'm *just* making a statement a little bit gentler.  I'm *really* trying to overstate my case.  I'm not getting the point across as well as I am able.\n\nI realize that now.\n\nOne huge dose of humility down, one to go.  The Phrase Arcs applet is near and dear to my heart, as it uses the Processing API - yet another DSL high on my list that I've only toyed with at a rudimentary level.\n\nThis particular set of arcs is from a post I wrote [describing a day in London](http://www.infiniteabyss.org/blog/archives/37).  Note the highlighted arc.  \"Lesser monarch\" seemed like an interesting combination of words at first, especially in conjunction with graves and memorials.  Search through the post and you'll find these three two word phrases:\n* lesser functionaries\n* lesser colleagues\n* lesser monarchs\n\nHmm.. a bit ostentatious, don't you think?  It seems to me like I'm trying to use an ornamental piece of language to cover a lack of new content.  I've latched onto a particular phrase in my head rather than using those fluid rules of grammar and content to create thoughts the reader can actually ingest.  Indirect repetition is not the same thing.\n\n#### Humility\n\nI've found a couple of concerning problems in my writing using some nifty automated text visualizations.  That's quite humbling.  You have no idea how many \"sort of\"'s, \"really\"'s, and \"like\"'s I had to consciously prevent myself from writing in this entry.  \n\nSince you've managed to make it this far, I'll let you in on a little secret.  I'm gearing up to participate in [NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org) this November.  I don't know yet if I have the chops to write anything of substance, but I'm going to give it a shot. \n\nIn the meantime, I'll keep plodding along.  Words being the simplest, most axiomatic form for any human thought, it's important that I get better at it.  You should get better at it too, even if you're already really good.  \n\nIt's easy to feel too stupid, too lazy, or too complacent to work hard at a problem like this.  Whenever that happens, I default back to a quote of Paul Graham's about Isaac Newton and his work ethic:  *\"You only get one life. Why not do something huge? The phrase \"paradigm shift\" is overused now, but Kuhn was onto something. And you know more are out there, separated from us by what will later seem a surprisingly thin wall of laziness and stupidity.

I'm two weeks away from starting [one helluva task](http://www.nanowrimo.org/).  My days are filled with a haze of energy at work.  My evenings are filled with social commitments and slowly increasing free time to sit in my newly finished study - my haven - surrounded by mellow music and belt out the occasional rational thought.  Both are currently frequented by stomach churning of increasing amplitude as I try to keep my nerves in check.  I don't know what I'm made of yet, I've made it a point to avoid the limits, to always retain an excuse in case of failure.  This time the excuses are getting checked.  The limits don't exist.  In two weeks, it's make or break time.  I'll either reach 50,000 words or I won't.  I'm not expecting a masterpiece.  I want to follow the NaNoWriMo philosophy - I want to stop reaching for the thesaurus every 5 seconds, the excuse machine (Internet) every 2 seconds, and prove that I've got enough mettle to suffer through the highs and lows and actually produce something that could, after countless hours of frustration spent fixing it, become a lucid and interesting story.  God it scares me.  This whole little rant being only 2400 words and 2.5 hours of work, it scares me even more (The NaNoWriMo 50K count breaks down to 1667 a day).  Still, in the middle of cold sweats, nervous tics, excitement, character traits, and scene outlines, I've had some thoughts moldering that I wanted to get out before they're too stale to resurrect.\n\n#### I'm not voting\n\nThere.  I said it.  I'm not voting.  Before you get all up in arms about how my vote counts and how it's my chance to be a cog in the great wheel of democracy [1], allow me a few words to explain, because this is at least a conscious, reasonably well informed decision.  \n\nFirst, let's do this by the numbers.  The electoral votes for Maryland, where I live, have a [100% chance of going for Obama](http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/).  100%!  At least Pennsylvania has 1% for McCain.  So even if I were to want to vote for McCain, my vote has literally no visibility in the election whatsoever.  You're welcome to suggest that the Bradley Effect is possible in certain situations, and I can't dispute the possibility.  It's easy to look at state voting populations and assume that polling simply reads general trends.  But the [math behind using small sample set polling](http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/10/10/small-samples-and-the-margin-of-error/), done properly, is overwhelming.  Confidence ratings on sampling are high.\n\nSo I have no real say in the electoral selections for my state.  One could argue on numbers alone that a vote is far more important in a swing state like Virginia or Florida.  There are places where the electoral votes have a real possibility of going to either major candidate.  \n\nI still wouldn't vote.  On purpose.  I believe there's a drastic difference between an uninformed vote and an informed vote.  I think a majority of the votes in this election will be uninformed.  My no-vote is a vote of no-confidence, not in the candidates necessarily, but in the political system as it stands presently.\n\nThere are two types of uninformed votes: the \"party line\" votes and the undecided coin-flip votes.\n\nI've tried over the last few weeks to have a few discussions on politics.  I've witnessed a few as well.  It is absolutely baffling to me how a process so supposedly central to our country's workings can have such a polarizing effect on almost everyone.  But the worst part seems to be that the more polarized you appear, the more uninformed you actually are.  It seems as if everyone's opinion is simply regurgitated and flavored by whatever particular media brands that person relies on.  And the media being such an *unbiased and civil* institution, passes on only the *unblemished* truth of every situation.\n\nI don't think a vote can possibly be informed if a person honestly believes they can be pigeonholed into one of two political parties.  The parties no longer appear to represent issues.  Rather they represent stakes of power in governing bodies.  These can be bought and sold by lobbies, unions, or other groups.  When I listen to party officials on either side debate, there seems to be no rational thought beyond a plea to sway the balance of power.  As soon as I hear accusations and blame (or hosannahs) being cast on the shoulders of either party so generously as exist in the media today, I immediately resign myself to missing any rational discussion on an issue.  (The best places I've found for some accountability of this sort of powermongering are CSPAN - see the debates on the floor, or the votes cast - or sites like [FactCheck](http://www.factcheck.org/).)  The party line vote is simply fishing for power in people-turned-lemmings.  \n\nUndecided votes can also be uninformed.  Certainly, everyone has a right to take their time forming an opinion and selecting the best candidate.  But let's say you get into the voting booth and you still just don't know who would be better.  So you flip a coin and vote.  What has your vote just done?  Has it really counted?  Does it really *mean* anything?  I don't think this could qualify as \"Rocking the Vote\", despite what MTV might advertise.\n\nI would argue that a citizen with a relatively equal comparison of the candidates would do no harm in not voting, and would possibly do some good.  This is the situation I'm in.  I certainly see some differences between Obama and McCain.  There are positives (Obama - deep thinker, smart; McCain - experience and national defense understanding) and negatives (Obama - abortion; McCain - same lack of perspective or adaptability in thinking as W.).  When I look at the actual effects each candidate would have on my life and the direction of the country the way I prioritize it, I see only very small differences.\n\nTaxes can serve as an example issue.  The subject is generally polarizing.  Those party-line folks on both sides will proselytize through the media that only they have the golden ticket.  They'll swear up and down in 15 second sound bytes that one or the other candidate will do good on some blanket statement.  On both sides, they're idiots.  If I look at the actual tax difference I would see, the change is within one percent.  Taxes, from a short term policy perspective, suddenly becomes much less of an issue as a voter.\n\n#### Two levels of abstraction\n\nI do think my no-vote, meagerly informed as it is, says *something*.  The polarization of high profile presidential elections by the media and political parties has, in my mind, eradicated a rational debate on the governing of the country.  The grab for power devalues the foresight of politicians by ensuring that whatever happens within the next five minutes will settle the correctness of a position.  I would love to see stances on energy, foreign relations, technology, science, education, and taxes that look at the next century instead of the next ten years.  Sometimes it takes a long time.  I want to see debates that consider entirely new means of satisfying problems, rather than simply playing with the same sliders on the same graphs.  Sometimes it takes paradigm shifts.\n\nI'll use my position on two topics to illustrate my point:\n\nTaxes in this country are completely ridiculous.  They're overcomplicated, often preposterous, poorly weighted, poorly regulated by the IRS, and poorly serviced.  In the meantime, we have a [ratio of GDP to national debt](http://home.comcast.net/~markthoma/Graphics/federal-debt-GDP.jpg) that is skyrocketing.  Considering the size of our government, our ridiculous budget deficits, and our many-zeroed debt, it seems prudent to ensure government income based on taxes.  It's entirely possible that the right answer in the short term is to raise taxes (where the short term is on the order of a decade).\n\nBut in the long run, I'm a huge proponent of a drastic overhaul of the entire system.  Galbraith said, \"*It is a well known and very important fact that America’s founding fathers did not like taxation without representation. It is a lesser known and equally important fact that they did not much like taxation with representation.*\"  As a nation, we've lost sight of the intentions of our founders.  We've forgotten that the income tax was only instated in 1913.  In the long run, the current tax system ought to be an outlying data point, not an acceptable trendline.\n\nEducation in this country suffers from difficult problems as well.  High costs and poor performances, especially in cities, keep everyone on edge and expecting far better results.  Some general changes to the current system are most certainly required.  Teachers need better pay, scholarships for gifted students must be available, and an acceptable standard for all students must be reached.  But these answers won't fix our long term problems.\n\nEducation needs a much longer, generational perspective too.  It's hugely important to remember that the education system we've inherited was created for the needs of mildly educated skilled blue and white collar labor to fuel the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century.  As our entire global economy shifts more and more to a knowledge based economy, the same system will crumble.  As more kids go to college, the meaning of a degree becomes worthless.  As more kids try to adapt to some average standard, the [creativity and inventiveness](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html) that actually drives human achievement is literally learned out of kids. [2]\n\nOur nation's political commentary desperately needs to overcome its shortsightedness.\n\n#### Honest Abe\n\nOf course, the shortsightedness itself is a long term problem too.  We won't get there too quickly, but the Internet and other new forms of communication that remove the traditional media from power are taking the biggest steps right now.  TV changed the way we deal with elections, and it's only just now starting to change again.\n\nThis November marks the 45th anniversary of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Texas.  He will still have a profound effect on the outcome of this election.  JFK and his memory as a young, elegant president who had his position snatched away has been memorialized in Americana.  The idea of the face of America, as that's what the President has been since World War II, being eradicated affects us all, and rightly so.  America has had a fixation with the image of that type of President since the assassination.  Obama seems to fit the same mold in many ways, and he's the first real chance America has for the same type of presidential image.\n\nThe democratic presidential nomination is a position Obama should have no business holding [3].  He never should have beaten Hillary.  The legacy she holds with the American populace after her husband's popularity and scandal combined with the media darling image she's cultivated since leaving the White House should have made her a shoe-in for the grab.  But she didn't get it.  Why not?\n\nOne of the most frequent thoughts that passes through my head while watching major sporting events is why enormous companies like FedEx, Nike, and Visa advertise so much.  I understand this seems tangential; bear with me, I'm getting there.  We assume that since big companies are clearly profitable we would use them no matter what.  But if Nike didn't advertise, and Puma suddenly came out with a glorious, fabulous campaign slogan - a catchy song and something like \"[My better is better than your better](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4TbxS_CdWE)\" for example - well, a lot of high school kids would be wearing Puma instead of Nike. \n\nObama has an amazing campaign engine generating that sort of symbol.  Hillary never did and neither does McCain.  In fact, no political campaign has ever done what Obama is doing so successfully now.  He's driving a new type of political branding the same way that Jordan drove branding for athletes in the 80s.  He's leveraged his charisma through his TV appearances, and he's even using the new communications by mass texting potential voters during primaries.  It would be foolish to suggest those strategies are anything but brilliant.  \n\nThe Kennedy Fixation is at its height right now.  The whole country, from both political parties, demands change.  Change is far easier to see in a young idealist thinker like Obama than in an old, stodgy, experienced veteran like McCain, no matter how smart he may be.  And like Paul Graham can tell you far more eloquently than I can: [it's charisma stupid](http://www.paulgraham.com/charisma.html).\n\nCharisma has changed the game.  The Presidential seat is different since World War II.  Certainly Kennedy contributed to that change, but so did Nixon, Reagan, and Clinton in various ways.  I wonder just how often we get the \"best\" candidate when so much of the race is guided by charisma and projection.\n\nIt's interesting to consider how some past presidents might have fared today.  Would Thomas Jefferson, a rather intellectual and introspective fellow, ever have achieved that office?  Almost certainly he was the smartest president we've ever had, and he's left the most indelible mark in our country through his gifts of eloquence.  \n\nHe never would be elected today.\n\nWhat about George Washington, our first hallowed president?  President Washington took office only reluctantly, and held a second term even more reluctantly.  He led the country in its delicate infancy, and blazed the way for later successes.  In his [farewell address](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington%27s_Farewell_Address), he warned of the power of political parties and how it might ruin the democratic process.  His advice seems apropos today.\n\nHe never would be elected today.\n\nWhat about Abe Lincoln?  A remarkably somber character with occasional bouts of depression, sometimes bordering on suicidal.  President Lincoln was a solid lawyer with then polarizing views on the issue of slavery.\n\nHe never would be elected today.\n\nIt's interesting that all of the attention and media hype lends itself towards reflection of the presidential candidates as people, as the \"face of America\" rather than the issues they champion.  It gets downright scary when you consider that the paragons of the office we aspire to duplicate would never themselves be elected.  \n\nThe culture of the TV sound byte has changed the entire physiognomy of our political process (tell me, do you really want a president that's just an \"ordinary American\" like you?  I want somebody quite extraordinary).  Since my vote counts so desperately, and I see two major candidates that herald no particular movements away from the political status quo, I will consider my no-vote a vote of no confidence.  I love my country.  It has the best backbone of governing philosophy ever wrought by mankind.  I want the political system to get out of the way of our country's greatness, so that it can go about the business of being great.  I hope more people start demanding a change, not just in office, but to the entire two party political system that seems, in retrospect, so far in civility, justice, honor, and freedom from what our forefathers hoped to achieve.\n\n[1] \"Democracy is the worst form of government, except all the others that have been tried.\" - Churchill\n\n[2] \"Humanity has advanced, when it has advanced, not because it has been sober, responsible and cautious, but because it has been playful, rebellious, and immature.\" - Tom Robbins\n\n[3] Please note too that any discussions of the candidates are for purposes of explaining my point of view, not for endorsement or condemnation.\n","html":"<h4 id=\"anticipationtypicalunrelatedopeningparagraph\">Anticipation (typical unrelated opening paragraph)</h4>\n\n<p>Anticipation is a bitch.  I'm two weeks away from starting <a href=\"http://www.nanowrimo.org/\">one helluva task</a>.  My days are filled with a haze of energy at work.  My evenings are filled with social commitments and slowly increasing free time to sit in my newly finished study - my haven - surrounded by mellow music and belt out the occasional rational thought.  Both are currently frequented by stomach churning of increasing amplitude as I try to keep my nerves in check.  I don't know what I'm made of yet, I've made it a point to avoid the limits, to always retain an excuse in case of failure.  This time the excuses are getting checked.  The limits don't exist.  In two weeks, it's make or break time.  I'll either reach 50,000 words or I won't.  I'm not expecting a masterpiece.  I want to follow the NaNoWriMo philosophy - I want to stop reaching for the thesaurus every 5 seconds, the excuse machine (Internet) every 2 seconds, and prove that I've got enough mettle to suffer through the highs and lows and actually produce something that could, after countless hours of frustration spent fixing it, become a lucid and interesting story.  God it scares me.  This whole little rant being only 2400 words and 2.5 hours of work, it scares me even more (The NaNoWriMo 50K count breaks down to 1667 a day).  Still, in the middle of cold sweats, nervous tics, excitement, character traits, and scene outlines, I've had some thoughts moldering that I wanted to get out before they're too stale to resurrect.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"imnotvoting\">I'm not voting</h4>\n\n<p>There.  I said it.  I'm not voting.  Before you get all up in arms about how my vote counts and how it's my chance to be a cog in the great wheel of democracy [1], allow me a few words to explain, because this is at least a conscious, reasonably well informed decision.  </p>\n\n<p>First, let's do this by the numbers.  The electoral votes for Maryland, where I live, have a <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/\">100% chance of going for Obama</a>.  100%!  At least Pennsylvania has 1% for McCain.  So even if I were to want to vote for McCain, my vote has literally no visibility in the election whatsoever.  You're welcome to suggest that the Bradley Effect is possible in certain situations, and I can't dispute the possibility.  It's easy to look at state voting populations and assume that polling simply reads general trends.  But the <a href=\"http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/10/10/small-samples-and-the-margin-of-error/\">math behind using small sample set polling</a>, done properly, is overwhelming.  Confidence ratings on sampling are high.</p>\n\n<p>So I have no real say in the electoral selections for my state.  One could argue on numbers alone that a vote is far more important in a swing state like Virginia or Florida.  There are places where the electoral votes have a real possibility of going to either major candidate.  </p>\n\n<p>I still wouldn't vote.  On purpose.  I believe there's a drastic difference between an uninformed vote and an informed vote.  I think a majority of the votes in this election will be uninformed.  My no-vote is a vote of no-confidence, not in the candidates necessarily, but in the political system as it stands presently.</p>\n\n<p>There are two types of uninformed votes: the \"party line\" votes and the undecided coin-flip votes.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried over the last few weeks to have a few discussions on politics.  I've witnessed a few as well.  It is absolutely baffling to me how a process so supposedly central to our country's workings can have such a polarizing effect on almost everyone.  But the worst part seems to be that the more polarized you appear, the more uninformed you actually are.  It seems as if everyone's opinion is simply regurgitated and flavored by whatever particular media brands that person relies on.  And the media being such an <em>unbiased and civil</em> institution, passes on only the <em>unblemished</em> truth of every situation.</p>\n\n<p>I don't think a vote can possibly be informed if a person honestly believes they can be pigeonholed into one of two political parties.  The parties no longer appear to represent issues.  Rather they represent stakes of power in governing bodies.  These can be bought and sold by lobbies, unions, or other groups.  When I listen to party officials on either side debate, there seems to be no rational thought beyond a plea to sway the balance of power.  As soon as I hear accusations and blame (or hosannahs) being cast on the shoulders of either party so generously as exist in the media today, I immediately resign myself to missing any rational discussion on an issue.  (The best places I've found for some accountability of this sort of powermongering are CSPAN - see the debates on the floor, or the votes cast - or sites like <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/\">FactCheck</a>.)  The party line vote is simply fishing for power in people-turned-lemmings.  </p>\n\n<p>Undecided votes can also be uninformed.  Certainly, everyone has a right to take their time forming an opinion and selecting the best candidate.  But let's say you get into the voting booth and you still just don't know who would be better.  So you flip a coin and vote.  What has your vote just done?  Has it really counted?  Does it really <em>mean</em> anything?  I don't think this could qualify as \"Rocking the Vote\", despite what MTV might advertise.</p>\n\n<p>I would argue that a citizen with a relatively equal comparison of the candidates would do no harm in not voting, and would possibly do some good.  This is the situation I'm in.  I certainly see some differences between Obama and McCain.  There are positives (Obama - deep thinker, smart; McCain - experience and national defense understanding) and negatives (Obama - abortion; McCain - same lack of perspective or adaptability in thinking as W.).  When I look at the actual effects each candidate would have on my life and the direction of the country the way I prioritize it, I see only very small differences.</p>\n\n<p>Taxes can serve as an example issue.  The subject is generally polarizing.  Those party-line folks on both sides will proselytize through the media that only they have the golden ticket.  They'll swear up and down in 15 second sound bytes that one or the other candidate will do good on some blanket statement.  On both sides, they're idiots.  If I look at the actual tax difference I would see, the change is within one percent.  Taxes, from a short term policy perspective, suddenly becomes much less of an issue as a voter.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"twolevelsofabstraction\">Two levels of abstraction</h4>\n\n<p>I do think my no-vote, meagerly informed as it is, says <em>something</em>.  The polarization of high profile presidential elections by the media and political parties has, in my mind, eradicated a rational debate on the governing of the country.  The grab for power devalues the foresight of politicians by ensuring that whatever happens within the next five minutes will settle the correctness of a position.  I would love to see stances on energy, foreign relations, technology, science, education, and taxes that look at the next century instead of the next ten years.  Sometimes it takes a long time.  I want to see debates that consider entirely new means of satisfying problems, rather than simply playing with the same sliders on the same graphs.  Sometimes it takes paradigm shifts.</p>\n\n<p>I'll use my position on two topics to illustrate my point:</p>\n\n<p>Taxes in this country are completely ridiculous.  They're overcomplicated, often preposterous, poorly weighted, poorly regulated by the IRS, and poorly serviced.  In the meantime, we have a <a href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~markthoma/Graphics/federal-debt-GDP.jpg\">ratio of GDP to national debt</a> that is skyrocketing.  Considering the size of our government, our ridiculous budget deficits, and our many-zeroed debt, it seems prudent to ensure government income based on taxes.  It's entirely possible that the right answer in the short term is to raise taxes (where the short term is on the order of a decade).</p>\n\n<p>But in the long run, I'm a huge proponent of a drastic overhaul of the entire system.  Galbraith said, \"<em>It is a well known and very important fact that America’s founding fathers did not like taxation without representation. It is a lesser known and equally important fact that they did not much like taxation with representation.</em>\"  As a nation, we've lost sight of the intentions of our founders.  We've forgotten that the income tax was only instated in 1913.  In the long run, the current tax system ought to be an outlying data point, not an acceptable trendline.</p>\n\n<p>Education in this country suffers from difficult problems as well.  High costs and poor performances, especially in cities, keep everyone on edge and expecting far better results.  Some general changes to the current system are most certainly required.  Teachers need better pay, scholarships for gifted students must be available, and an acceptable standard for all students must be reached.  But these answers won't fix our long term problems.</p>\n\n<p>Education needs a much longer, generational perspective too.  It's hugely important to remember that the education system we've inherited was created for the needs of mildly educated skilled blue and white collar labor to fuel the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century.  As our entire global economy shifts more and more to a knowledge based economy, the same system will crumble.  As more kids go to college, the meaning of a degree becomes worthless.  As more kids try to adapt to some average standard, the <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html\">creativity and inventiveness</a> that actually drives human achievement is literally learned out of kids. [2]</p>\n\n<p>Our nation's political commentary desperately needs to overcome its shortsightedness.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"honestabe\">Honest Abe</h4>\n\n<p>Of course, the shortsightedness itself is a long term problem too.

Along the way, I've gotten to thinking more about installations and have paid more attention to the hoops many people jump through with common pieces of software.\n\nHere are some rules for making a great first impression.\n\n### One Click Is All It Takes\n\nNo piece of end-user software, aside from maybe an operating system, is so important that it needs to take more than one click to install.  You don't coddle a user by flashing a Welcome Screen that introduces them to your install wizard.  You coddle them by making them say, \"Gosh, that's it?  That was easy.\"  On our product, we went from a series of 4 or 5 dialogs asking various questions or supplying intermediate steps.  The user input between steps was generally just to click \"Next\".  They really don't need to do that.  Now, our install process can be completed in one click.  They hit the install button and off it runs.  After completion, it brings up the app for you.\n\n### As Simple As Possible, But Not Simpler\n\nMost apps have some configuration options that can be set during installation.  Our install screen provides a couple of options for configuration, but it doesn't force the user to act on any of them.  They can still just click \"Install\".  We've taken pains to provide smart defaults so that 90% of our users don't have to do a thing.  And that's perfect.  Most users don't care.  You might be aghast that your log files don't end up in a certain directory, but normal people aren't.\n\nGall's Law applies here.  To be fair, it applies most places.\n\n\"*A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system.*\"\n\nStarting with a big dialog with lots of different options and settings is a bad idea.  Putting one setting on each page of your \"wizard\" and making a user hit \"Next\" in between doesn't help.  Instead of starting with all of your configuration, start with nothing and see if you can add *nothing* to it.  I'll bet you can.  Only in rare cases, like operating systems, is there any configuration that is really and truly necessary.  Get to the point when there isn't anything left to remove from your install options.\n\n“*You know you’ve achieved perfection in design, not when you have nothing more to add, but when you have nothing more to take away.*” - Antoine de Saint Exupery\n\n### Stay Responsible Over Your Domain\n\nThere are libraries and installers available to take the coding work for install off your hands.  This seems intriguing at first.  It should let you focus on your very important, application specific, domain specific code.  I recommend resisting this temptation and writing your installers yourself.\n\nOur original installer for our Java product was IzPack. That made it needlessly long, and it did not fail gracefully when it failed.  I looked at replacing it with another IzPack installer as well as JSmooth, Launch4J, and Antigen.  In my botched attempts, I still had no warm and fuzzy feeling that I was doing anything better than the previous installer.  There were still multiple dialogs and they were still overwhelmingly filled with that ridiculously melancholy Windows gray color (where did they get that?).\n\nIn the end, we ended up writing the whole installer ourselves.  I feel rather pleased with it.  It's simple and effective.  More importantly, it doesn't piss off our users.  If you believe, like me, that first impressions are important, then installation ranks just as highly as all of your really exciting business logic.  Your user just gave you money, or is deciding to give you money.  Your job is to convince them they're making the right choice.  It shouldn't be ambiguous.\n\n### Be Elegant\n\nThe default Windows blue and grey is, to me, as depressing as deteriorating cubicle walls affixed with Dilbert cartoons.  You can do better, especially if you're keeping control of the design and coding of installation.  Pick a color theme that resonates with your product.  Make your widgets look like they do in your app.  Keep the fonts appropriate.  If you have a designer available, make sure to get input.   First impressions, and all that.\n\n### Leave The User In Charge\n\nFinally, the one truly unforgivable wrong is taking control away from the user.  When the iPhone 2.0 software first came out, the biggest complaint was the lack of control.  If I hit the lock button there was a several second pause before I heard the little clicky sound.  The same several second pause occurred when opening Mail or SMS messages.  It made most people on edge and frustrated.  [Joel talks a lot about that clicky sound](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/HighNotes.html).\n\nDuring installation, a user should have knowledge of what's going on at all times.  If you're busy doing something in the background, give them a progress bar that updates appropriately.  A step shouldn't be surprising in duration in any way.  If it takes 4 seconds or 40 seconds, it's your job to make sure the expectation is set.\n\n### Imitate What You Like\n\nI love the Mac install process.  You just drag and drop your application into the Applications folder.  That's it, nothing else.  A lot of apps go one step further, [like Firefox](http://www.myfirstmac.com/images/uploads/articleImages/FIREFOX-WINDOW.gif).  The window lets you do only one thing - drag the Firefox app icon into the Apps folder.  Simple, elegant with a nice little semi-transparent Firefox logo, and effective.  I immediately think that this browser must be a slim, elegant little piece of software that stays out of the way when I'm using it for it's primary purpose: browsing web pages.  It just does its job.\n\n[Posterous](http://posterous.com/) is an excellent webapp example.  They've removed the install process completely - if you want to start a Posterous account, you just email your first post and they do the account setup for you.  What a great system!\n\nKeep an eye out on what other apps do (./configure,make don't count).  Keep your interface elegant.  Keep it simple.  And keep control of the code.\n","html":"<p>It doesn't take the extreme examples to realize that the general state of user interfaces in software suck.  The available levels of interface design are passable, bad, and OMG WTF?!  If you want to sell a product, it makes sense that you want to quell your user's use of expletives.  In fact, you don't just want to pacify them with something that's \"good enough\", you want to make them love you.  You want them exalting you with such loyalty that they'd rather cut off pieces of anatomy than let someone they care about use a competitor's deficient product.

It's been two months instead of one, and this little place has been empty of new content.  Even more drafts sit in situ waiting patiently for substance, but by and large this front has been quiet.  \n\nI've not been idle.  \n\n#### November\n\nFirst, I finished [NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org).  The official word count was 50,721.  The official page count was 227 according to [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.html), my new favorite writing program.  That really was a wild month, with far more ups and downs than I expected.  The word count doesn't nearly tell the whole story.  \n\n50,000 words is a lot.  It's kind of an absurd thing and I'm awfully surprised I was able to do it.  I never had much belief in being able to accomplish a very substantive task because, well, I have never had the discipline to finish a substantive task.  I feel, if nothing else, that I've absolved myself of that particular crutch.  I had it in my mind to do something and it was completed.  Without getting too Oprah book-of-the-week, that's a really nice feeling.\n\nNext, I didn't actually finish the book.  It has no ending and I found myself purposely avoiding key scenes because I was too scared to write them.  I felt fine with building up the story, getting into the characters, describing setting.  But the actual meat of the plot was too scary.  The general outline of the plot is complete and I know exactly where the characters are going and how it will end.  But getting there is still ahead of me.  The main scenes for all the subplots, as well as the conclusion that settles the main character are simply ideas in my head with maybe a few brief sentences as chapter filler to remind me of key themes.\n\nI definitely cheated.  There's a lot of cruft.  A lot of filler.  There are sentences that stop dead and end with \"what the fuck am I talking about?\"  Realistically, I think I've written maybe 38,000 words that I might actually keep after rewriting through several more drafts.  I think when the story is completed it will be maybe 75K words before cutting, hopefully at least 60k after edits.\n\nI was pleased to find that many of the ideas that drove the story came about in the course of writing.  In other words, I started with an idea, a main character, and some various characteristics.  As I wrote, new scenarios entered the text, different characters did different things, new ideas melded with old ones.  The process was far more organic than I expected.  I've become so used to organizing ideas in the context of code or nonfiction, that I fully expected to be lacking in my ability to \"improvise\".  But that came soon enough.\n\nWriting fiction is harder than writing nonfiction.  I don't have a completely fair comparison here as I've never written anything nonfiction that comes close to the length of a book.  But it seems as if the process would be similar on a larger scale.  Organizing thoughts and writing out blocks of text would be the same.\n\nWriting fiction is also harder than writing code, largely for the same reason.  I touched on this [a bit in an earlier post](http://www.infiniteabyss.org/2008/08/22/an_automated_method_for_making_your_writing_suck_less.html).  Where code often has some set of structures to understand or accomplish elegance, fiction often does not.\n\n#### December\n\nBy December 1, I was exhausted from writing and quite tired of it, so I took a large break and focused on other things.  I've setup a Github account and have been acquainting myself with git and some simple projects.  I've also moved some little snippets of code to Github.\n\nThe biggest change has been moving all of my blogging onto github all [stuffed in one repository](http://github.com/mhyrr/mhyrr.github.com/tree/master).  This has been a breath of fresh air.  I've been looking for something to get away from Wordpress for awhile, but all the other options seemed to be more of the same overgrown and cumbersome blogging engines.  Reading elsewhere, my problem was not scarce.  One of the github founders, Tom Preston-Warner, [described the same problem](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) recently as well as his [home grown solution](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master) for it.  I've been playing with Jekyll for several weeks now and it fits the bill.  There's lots of potential here too for a more generic site generator with user-denoted page hierarchies and links, headers and footers.  \n\nGithub has adopted Jekyll for [Github Pages](http://github.com/blog/272-github-pages).  So now, in addition to infiniteabyss.org, I'm also hosting on mhyrr.github.com for free.  While I'm still using the Jekyll gem, I have a great testbed for making sure new content is created appropriately.  A simple 'git pull' on my infiniteabyss.org domain updates the main site automatically.\n\nIt's been a really nice change.  Everything is simple but it still handles the things I need.  And it's all revisioned!  Who could ask for more?\n\nSo now it's January of 09 and there's lots of work to do.  As usual I've been doing too much thinking and not enough writing.  Hopefully I'll continue this trend of recording some of it for my later self.  \n\n#### The Big Questions\n\nThe two really big questions I get asked after my November experience are \"So is it done?\" and \"When can I read it?\".  It's definitely not done and won't be for at least several months.  I'm hoping to have a solid first draft *complete* by the end of February.  Then it will be more months of editing before I'm willing to show it to anyone besides a very small few.  So when can you read it?  Maybe never.  At the earliest, this summer.  \n\nOne last interesting thing happened at Christmas.  Ever since I started trying to do a bit of writing, I've been compelled to get my family to write more too.  All of them are voracious readers and, from what little I've had the privilege to read, they are very solid writers too.  My grandmother wrote a long notebook containing recollections from her time in England along with history and travel tips.  I read that during my trip there last Spring.\n\nApparently during lunch this fall I said to her, \"you should write more.\"  She took it to heart and gave me an incredible Christmas present: an \"anecdotal genealogy\" of my mother's side of my family.  When completed, it will chronicle my various family trees as far back as is known.  The writing is wonderful and the subject matter is obviously of high interest to me.  It's been wonderful to read thus far.  Not only I, but my children, and their children will be richer because she decided to write more.\n\nYou should write more.","html":"<p>Now it's New Year's.

There's lots of potential here too for a more generic site generator with user-denoted page hierarchies and links, headers and footers.  </p>\n\n<p>Github has adopted Jekyll for <a href=\"http://github.com/blog/272-github-pages\">Github Pages</a>.  So now, in addition to infiniteabyss.org, I'm also hosting on mhyrr.github.com for free.  While I'm still using the Jekyll gem, I have a great testbed for making sure new content is created appropriately.  A simple 'git pull' on my infiniteabyss.org domain updates the main site automatically.</p>\n\n<p>It's been a really nice change.  Everything is simple but it still handles the things I need.  And it's all revisioned!  Who could ask for more?</p>\n\n<p>So now it's January of 09 and there's lots of work to do.  As usual I've been doing too much thinking and not enough writing.  Hopefully I'll continue this trend of recording some of it for my later self.  </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"thebigquestions\">The Big Questions</h4>\n\n<p>The two really big questions I get asked after my November experience are \"So is it done?\" and \"When can I read it?\".  It's definitely not done and won't be for at least several months.  I'm hoping to have a solid first draft <em>complete</em> by the end of February.  Then it will be more months of editing before I'm willing to show it to anyone besides a very small few.  So when can you read it?  Maybe never.  At the earliest, this summer.  </p>\n\n<p>One last interesting thing happened at Christmas.  Ever since I started trying to do a bit of writing, I've been compelled to get my family to write more too.  All of them are voracious readers and, from what little I've had the privilege to read, they are very solid writers too.  My grandmother wrote a long notebook containing recollections from her time in England along with history and travel tips.  I read that during my trip there last Spring.</p>\n\n<p>Apparently during lunch this fall I said to her, \"you should write more.\"  She took it to heart and gave me an incredible Christmas present: an \"anecdotal genealogy\" of my mother's side of my family.  When completed, it will chronicle my various family trees as far back as is known.  The writing is wonderful and the subject matter is obviously of high interest to me.  It's been wonderful to read thus far.  Not only I, but my children, and their children will be richer because she decided to write more.</p>\n\n<p>You should write more.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"de_DE","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2009-01-04T05:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2009-01-04T05:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2009-01-04T05:00:00.000Z","published_by":1,"visibility":"public","mobiledoc":null,"amp":null},{"id":31,"uuid":"75a092ce-1782-4260-aabe-c0cadf817eb0","title":"Customer Service Matters","slug":"customerservice","markdown":"Recently, I've had a couple of extremely positive experiences in customer service that have made me consider just how important it can be.  I wanted to share them with you.\n\n#### Martin+Osa\n\nA new Martin+Osa store opened up in my nearby mall and I went to check it out on a friend's recommendation.  The clothes were high quality and, more importantly, they fit properly.  I've long been frustrated by dress shirts built for 45 year old beer bellies.  \n\nEven more interesting, the shopping experience was pleasant.  The sales associates knew a bit about clothes, provided sound suggestions, and even provided soda, bottled water and light snacks.  I had been wanting a nice blazer of some sort for the winter months - just something simple that was not a part of a suit.  Martin+Osa had several such options at $280, which was a bit outside the range I was interested in spending, so I settled for some sweaters and jeans instead.\n\nSeveral weeks later however, the jackets went on sale on their website for a whopping 50% off.  Since I was pleased with the clothes I had purchased previously, I decided to grab one.  I was even more excited to find a 20% off promotional code online that worked for everything in the online store, including sales items.  That $280 jacket was now $112.\n\nWhen it arrived I fully expected to need to have it tailored, as required for all proper jackets.  I brought it in to Martin+Osa because they advertise free alterations for any purchases.  But jackets require a more expert hand and so the stores don't provide that service.  Instead, the lady took me up to the register, gave me $30 in cash and the card of a professional tailor to take the coat to.  That's it, no hesitation, no checking with the manager.  Just cash and an easy alternative.\n\n#### Charleston Restaurant\n\nJust before Christmas, a friend and I decided to go to the Charleston for a great dinner out.  We had been aching to go, since we both love food, and had been sort of waiting for an excuse which Christmas sort of provided.  We were stretching it I admit, but why the hell not.  So we went and had a delightful 6 course fine dining experience.  The entire meal was beautiful, each course more mouth watering than the next.  Our waiter was witty, dressed in a crisp suit, and had an in depth knowledge of the menu and the wine list.\n\nI had every expectation of ordering a glass of old Armagnac with dessert, but when the dessert menus were proffered, the list of fine old Madeira by the glass caught my eye.\n\nI am a wine lover.  Some probably say snob.  But I simply love wine, and I want other people to love it too.  I want them to have the same numinous experiences I have.  And I want them to be ready for those experiences when they happen, which means having some knowledge of the drink before tasting something transcendent.\n\nMadeira is what I consider my every day wine.  I drink it most frequently in the evening at home, or with a cigar.  One of the most fascinating things about Madeira is that it is virtually indestructible.  It can last for months or even years when uncorked.  It can last for centuries in the bottle.  19th century Madeira is not uncommon, although perhaps not as common as it once was.  18th century Madeira is still around, although exorbitantly expensive.  I haven't set aside the money to procure a couple of 19th century bottles, but I plan to at some point in the near future.\n\nThe oldest wine I had previously was a bottle of 1952 Verdelho Jubilee Selection I had found for my Mom's birthday.  Jubilee Selection wines had originally been set aside on the occasion of the Queen of England's coronation for her Jubilee years - i.e. 25th or 50th anniversary.  It was a fine old bottle, although not particularly to my taste.  Verdelho's are dry and this one had a sense of old coffee and bitter chocolate.  We enjoyed it, as much for the history than anything.\n\nThe Charleston now has a list of Madeira stretching back to 1907.  I immediately showed my dinner date and we began our scheming.  Should we try it?  Would it be worth it?  They were, afterall, over $60 for a 3 oz. pour.\n\nWe eventually decided on a 1912 Barbeito Bual at $84/glass.  We would split it to ease the pain a little, but really, how often do you have even the opportunity to try something like this?  As far as I know, the Charleston is the only restaurant in the area with such a selection.\n\nThe excitement mounted.  Finally, our waiter brought out the glass, not quite filled to the brim.  He had a pained look on his face.  \"I'm very sorry\" he said, \"this is the bottom of the last bottle of the 1912 and you have not received a full pour.  This glass is on the house.\"\n\nWell.\n\nFrom $84 to nothing.  A free glass of wine never tasted so good.  We savored the experience, taking probably a half an hour to finish that single glass.  The entire time she and I tried to conjure in our minds what was going on in the world 96 years ago.  World War I had not yet started and the sinking of the Titanic was still big news during the harvest.  We wondered when the people who picked these grapes had passed away, and whether they had ever tasted this vintage.  And in between our thoughts, the infinitely smooth taste of the wine lingered, inviting speechlessness and mystery over attempts at description. \n\nFor me, it was one of those transcendent experiences.  And it was free.\n\n#### Overachievement and Recurring Sales\n\nSince these two experiences happened in December, I've bought more from Martin+Osa and I already have another reservation to go back to the Charleston despite it's high price of entry.  They've sold me, completely, on customer service.  And not only just; I've told relatives, friends, and now, whomever listens to me ramble on my blog.  These were the kind of experiences that make you want to tell others, so that they might share it.  Let's see why..\n\n*  Most importantly, both products were high quality.  Customer service will never take the place of a quality product.\n\n*  A promotional code should be a promotional code.  A deal should be a deal.  There should not be disclaimers, exceptions, or other negative paraphernalia.  It should just work, period.\n\n*  A refund, discount, or some other sort of perk for the customer is not and should never be a negotiation.  It's an opportunity to win the customer over, plain and simple.  In both of my examples, the companies came through beyond my expectations.  When you provide more than is expected, you create a zealous convert, recurring sales, and a growing base because you know they'll get the word out.\n\n*  Junior people with less responsibility should still have the ability to make snap decisions to help a customer.  Time should not have to be wasted consulting with a manager.  The same friend I went to dinner with works at one of the most prestigious hotels in Washington DC.  I asked her if she had the authority to comp guests or provide services.  She said yes, she can comp even an entire stay costing thousands of dollars if something is awry for a guest, with no need to consult someone higher up the line.\n\nThe one thing I can't stress enough is the product.  If it isn't any good, customer service won't matter one bit.  But if it is good, you can build on it.  Apple's stores are proof that it can scale.  In a consumer computer world where the standard customer service experience is a series of automated phone calls to some idiot half way across the world, Apple will do just about anything for you with one appointment at one of their stores.  They'll transfer all of our files from a PC to a Mac, reinstall an operating system while you wait, or recover all your music from your iPod.  Let's see your outsourced help desk worker do that over the phone.  I returned my iPhone to them with a day left on the warranty because one of the side volume buttons wasn't working.  The poor thing was beat to hell - scratched, dented and busted up.  They didn't ask questions.  They just handed me a brand new one.  I love the iPhone.  After that, I loved it even more.\n\nRecurring sales through customer satisfaction is one of the best ways to have long term success, and it's achieved when things go wrong, not when things go right.  So when things go wrong for a customer, you have an excellent opportunity to make a lasting impression.  Don't pass it up.","html":"<p>Recently, I've had a couple of extremely positive experiences in customer service that have made me consider just how important it can be.

Those hiring go about it all wrong.\n2.  Because of this, it's remarkably easy to bullshit your way through an interview.\n\nAll too often, teams, projects, or companies bring on people that they quickly realize are either completely or partially worthless.  The hiree doesn't actually have the skills on their resume, or didn't have a very large part in that system they said they built, or whatever.  And then all of a sudden you have someone who, because they're quite probably a nice person, you'll have a remarkably hard time firing despite the fact that they're a drag on your code production.\n\nNot that productivity has the last word.  If that person added a lot to culture, or process, or customer relationship insight, or some other slightly more fuzzy metric, then I wouldn't want to get rid of them either.  It's just very hard to tell which people you might hire are actually good at those things.\n\nAnd that statement introduces the problem quite well.  So I'll repeat it:\n\n*It's very hard to tell which people you might hire are actually good at what they claim to be good at.*\n\nThere's lots of reasons why this is true.  The reasons don't really matter.  The topic of being able to find good candidates through resumes and interviews has been covered ad nauseum by many, many others.  It's generally accepted as true.  What's more disturbing is pairing it directly with Brook's Law:\n\n*Assigning more programmers to a project running behind schedule will make it even later.*\n\nThis rule is easily made more general.  Adding programmers to a project increases its complexity rapidly.  (For the sake of this article, we'll define 'programmers' to mean those on a project with some relevant base level of technical proficiency, despite their actual duties.)  \n\n#### Hire Filter\n\n\nWhen I pair these two statements together, I come up with a rule I want to follow when considering job candidates.\n\n*I need someone I'm looking to hire to prove to me that I should hire them.*\n\nIn other words, the default state of my hire filter, before I've even met you, is not to hire you.  I'm sure you're a nice guy or gal.  I'm sure you know Blub.  I'm sure you have experience.  But you need to be able to prove that the value you add to a project is greater than the inherent complexity your addition to the project will create.\n\nIn most places I've ever been, and probably in most places everywhere, this isn't done.  Reading various articles about Google (notably Steve Yegge) leads one to the conclusion that Google implements something akin to a default no-hire policy.  They're more willing to take false negatives than they are false positives.\n\n#### Well, he's reasonably intelligent..\n\n\nFor everyone involved, including the interviewee, this should make complete sense.  It's just not very \"nice\", and maybe that's the reason not many people do it.  I'm not really sure.  I know I've been in that situation before too though.  I've seen someone's resume and thought, \"hey, not bad.\"  Then, I've seen them in an interview and thought, \"Well, he's reasonably intelligent...\"\n\nAnd then I remembered George Carlin..  \n\n<blockquote>\n<George Carlin>\n\t..Some people are really fucking stupid!\n\tDid you ever notice that? How many really stupid people you run into during the day? Goddamn there's a lot of stupid bastards walking around.  Carry a little pad and pencil with you. You'll wind up with thirty or forty names by the end of the day.  Look at it this way: *Think of how stupid the average person is and then realize that half of them are stupider than that.*  And it doesn't take you very long to spot one of them does it?  Takes you about eight seconds.  You'll be listening to some guy...then you'll say...\"this guy is fucking stupid!\"  \n\tThen there are some people, they're not stupid...they're full of shit.  That doesn't take very long to spot either, does it?  Takes you about the same amount of time.  You'll be listening to some guy..and saying, \"Well, he's reasonably intelligent......ahh, he's full of shit!\"\n</George Carlin>\n</blockquote>\n\nAnd again, this isn't entirely fair.  If I take a random 30 minute sampling of my intelligence, chances are it's way way below my running average, especially when I'm in a bland room filled with halogen lights and strangers asking me semi-technical questions.  Yeah, that's when I'm at my best.  Yet we all do that to people all the time, and we take that 30 minute sample as the average, and that's why it's so damn hard to figure out if someone is actually any good in an interview in the first place.\n\nBut besides that, part of Carlin's rant is empirically true.  Half the people out there are stupider than the average person, and the average person is rather stupid.  Interviews then become a chance to weed out the really fucking stupid people, because working with them would be just awful.  So there's this apparent tradeoff: you'll ditch the awful candidates and keep the average candidates.  Except according to Carlin they're pretty stupid too.  And according to Brooks, even if they aren't, they still have to overcome the inherent complexity of their addition to the project.  So isn't there some alternative?\n\nWell, yes.  Find someone that blows you away.  Find someone that has an amazing innate sense of design, that can do pointer arithmetic for complex structures in their head, that knows which git branch command line options lists both remote and local branches, whatever.  But be impressed.  When you're impressed, there's a higher percentage shot at actually finding someone competent.  It doesn't guarantee it, you're still taking a random 30 minute sampling, but your chances are better.\n\n#### Evil-ness\n\n\nHaving your default be [NO HIRE](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2009-06-26/no_hire.md#readme) sidesteps other interesting issues too, most notably evil hire practices.  The only reason some company would be ridiculous enough to want access to someone's social networking profiles is to actively find a magical reason *not* to hire someone.  Is it really that hard?  Just don't hire them!  Then, when you find someone really good you actually do want to hire, you won't care that they have drunk pictures of themselves on Facebook or that they're a member of the NRA.\n\n#### Apprenticeships\n\n\nEven with the no-hire default turned on, interviewing still is not the best thing in the world.  It's exhausting, stressful, uncomfortable, anxious, and you have to deal with lots of people that are either \"fucking stupid\" or \"full of shit\".  Fixing the process is a really hard problem, and I don't think there's a good answer out there yet.  My first thought was to bring people on for a trial period of sorts.  You get paid, but you have to prove your worth.  If after 6 months you've had substantial positive overall impact, congratulations you're hired.  \n\nBut this sucks too.  In fact I had a series of interviews with a company that went just like that.  The work sounded interesting and the folks I talked to were cool.  Then they gave me the offer - I would basically be temping through an agency for a period of time before becoming an employee.  I immediately said \"screw you\" very politely and walked the other way.\n\nSo that's not so good.  In fact, the only reasonable solution I can think of seems to be: hire people that are already in your \"worked-with\" social graph, allowing for path length of 2.  In other words, only hire or bring on people that you've worked well with personally or that come highly recommended by someone you've worked with personally.  I think I have a lot more to say about this idea, but I'll save it for another evening, hopefully soon.\n\nThe only major complication with the \"worked-with\" graph is the severe limit you place on personnel.  You are pulling from a much smaller pool.  If you listen to Joel Spolsky, Steve Yegge, or any of those sort of folks, the amazing candidates aren't generally out there for hire, so it isn't as if you're missing anything anyway.\n\n#### A Conclusion?\n\n\nTo sum up: The default when seeking to fill a position should be no-hire.  This isn't nice on the surface, but it's more honest and solves more problems.   Hiring average candidates fulfills Brook's Law.  Hiring by experiential reference is best.  So what have we learned?  Probably nothing, at least nothing that's going to change anytime soon.  No, that's not true - we learned George Carlin was good at making us laugh at the truth.\n","html":"<p>Recently, I've been close enough to hiring decisions to realize two things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Those hiring go about it all wrong.  </li>\n<li>Because of this, it's remarkably easy to bullshit your way through an interview.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>All too often, teams, projects, or companies bring on people that they quickly realize are either completely or partially worthless.

Nowhere is this more visible than the text editor: still both the most basic and the most profound computer application.\n\nEditors pushed keyboard shortcutting in the 1970s to places most people still never see, and never will see. \n\nWhile it's clear that most users, even advanced users, will never care to grok the many Vim navigation techniques, there's still a huge world of improvement for even simple tasks.  But before we get into them, there's the question of *why* most users will never use :%s/search/replace/c or even M-x M-c.  Duh, most people use the mouse.  Most people use Windows too.  They don't get the chutzpah of Unix, the power of little tiny commands and manipulations for atomic tasks.  \n\nEven as far as editors go, there's a big dispute between which way editors roll too.  I've read some articles lately that flatten IDEs like Eclipse because they're built to manipulate Java.  What a short-sighted perspective.  Java as a language is limited.  It will never be equal to some (most..) of the languages out there.  But the power of a language is not equivalent to the power of an editor's tooling for that language.  The inferiority actually requires more powerful tooling.  As a manipulator of text, I want to use powerful tools.  Emacs and Vim are great options.  TextMate is a great option (and what I generally use at home; what I'm using now in fact.)  But Eclipse and it's derivatives are also good options for specific forms of text manipulation. \n\nI think the reason the IDE gets maligned is actually much more basic than language features or tooling abilities.  It's the mouse.  The keyboard is the tool for power.  The mouse is the sign of a n00b.  Because many users of Eclipse rely heavily on the mouse, it's perceived as a tool for lesser users.\n\nTo be fair, this is justifiable.  Project manipulation in an IDE is mouse-based and it sucks.  The end result is that setting up a codebase gets perceived as magic rather than a set of knowable steps on the command line.  The Eclipse Text Editor is great for manipulating and sloshing through code though, and I actually enjoy the tooling that exists.  It's powerful and dead useful.  I think some of it could be a simple standard for most graphical text editors, including browsers.  Here are a couple of examples.\n\n### Ctrl-Left/Right Arrow\n**Ctrl-left arrow moves the cursor one word to the left.**\n**Ctrl-right arrow moves the cursor one word to the right.**\n\nFor most text editors, this is standard now, but for some it's not.  Flex's Text components don't implement this by default and it pisses me off, because Flex is usually so good about things like this.\n\n### Ctrl-Backspace\n**Ctrl-backspace deletes a word.**\n\nThis isn't strictly true.  It generally does some smarter manipulation based on punctuation and case.  So someStupidVariable| would actually become someStupid|.  Again, not everyone does this now, but they really should.  And you should use it.  Constantly.\n\n### Ctrl-Mouse Wheel\n**Ctrl-mouse wheel fast scrolls one page of text.**\n\nThis is basically equivalent to Page Up or Page Down.  It's a great way to skim quickly through a large file that's for some reason more navigable than using Page Up/Page Down.  This would be of great use in a browser especially.  Who really needs to increase and decrease text size that quick?  Come on Firefox!\n\n### Ctrl-Up/Down Arrow\n**Ctrl-up arrow slides the window of text up one line while maintaining cursor position.**\n**Ctrl-down arrow slides the window of text down one line while maintaining cursor position.**\n\nLess commonly used but equally nice.

Nowhere is this more visible than the text editor: still both the most basic and the most profound computer application.</p>\n\n<p>Editors pushed keyboard shortcutting in the 1970s to places most people still never see, and never will see. </p>\n\n<p>While it's clear that most users, even advanced users, will never care to grok the many Vim navigation techniques, there's still a huge world of improvement for even simple tasks.  But before we get into them, there's the question of <em>why</em> most users will never use :%s/search/replace/c or even M-x M-c.  Duh, most people use the mouse.  Most people use Windows too.  They don't get the chutzpah of Unix, the power of little tiny commands and manipulations for atomic tasks.  </p>\n\n<p>Even as far as editors go, there's a big dispute between which way editors roll too.  I've read some articles lately that flatten IDEs like Eclipse because they're built to manipulate Java.  What a short-sighted perspective.  Java as a language is limited.  It will never be equal to some (most..) of the languages out there.  But the power of a language is not equivalent to the power of an editor's tooling for that language.  The inferiority actually requires more powerful tooling.  As a manipulator of text, I want to use powerful tools.  Emacs and Vim are great options.  TextMate is a great option (and what I generally use at home; what I'm using now in fact.)  But Eclipse and it's derivatives are also good options for specific forms of text manipulation. </p>\n\n<p>I think the reason the IDE gets maligned is actually much more basic than language features or tooling abilities.  It's the mouse.  The keyboard is the tool for power.  The mouse is the sign of a n00b.  Because many users of Eclipse rely heavily on the mouse, it's perceived as a tool for lesser users.</p>\n\n<p>To be fair, this is justifiable.  Project manipulation in an IDE is mouse-based and it sucks.  The end result is that setting up a codebase gets perceived as magic rather than a set of knowable steps on the command line.  The Eclipse Text Editor is great for manipulating and sloshing through code though, and I actually enjoy the tooling that exists.  It's powerful and dead useful.  I think some of it could be a simple standard for most graphical text editors, including browsers.  Here are a couple of examples.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ctrlleftrightarrow\">Ctrl-Left/Right Arrow</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Ctrl-left arrow moves the cursor one word to the left.</strong>\n<strong>Ctrl-right arrow moves the cursor one word to the right.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For most text editors, this is standard now, but for some it's not.  Flex's Text components don't implement this by default and it pisses me off, because Flex is usually so good about things like this.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ctrlbackspace\">Ctrl-Backspace</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Ctrl-backspace deletes a word.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This isn't strictly true.  It generally does some smarter manipulation based on punctuation and case.  So someStupidVariable| would actually become someStupid|.  Again, not everyone does this now, but they really should.  And you should use it.  Constantly.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ctrlmousewheel\">Ctrl-Mouse Wheel</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Ctrl-mouse wheel fast scrolls one page of text.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is basically equivalent to Page Up or Page Down.  It's a great way to skim quickly through a large file that's for some reason more navigable than using Page Up/Page Down.  This would be of great use in a browser especially.  Who really needs to increase and decrease text size that quick?  Come on Firefox!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ctrlupdownarrow\">Ctrl-Up/Down Arrow</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Ctrl-up arrow slides the window of text up one line while maintaining cursor position.</strong>\n<strong>Ctrl-down arrow slides the window of text down one line while maintaining cursor position.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Less commonly used but equally nice.  Want more of that paragraph or method implementation viewable but don't want to lose your cursor position?  Get it in there, without reaching for the mouse!  I remember finding Ctrl-L in Emacs and being oddly giddy over it.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ctrlspace\">Ctrl-Space</h3>\n\n<p><strong>*Ctrl-space provides a list of possible word completions, based upon either a local lookup or a standard dictionary.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The above is strictly true for method/property completion too.

The browser takes care of recording a player's moves, so you can follow paths anywhere and if it doesn't pan out you just use the back button to retreat.

I hadn't either until recently.  \n\nChampernowne's Number is constructed of all the integers in [lexicographical order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order).  It looks like this in base 10: \n\t0.123456789101112131415161718192021...\nand like this in base 2:\n\t0.11011100101110111100010011010...\nand on and on.\n\nIt's interesting for a few reasons.  First, it's a [transcendental number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number).  It's also a [normal number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_number) (meaning the distribution of finite sequences in the number are uniform).  It never repeats.  It was the first constructed normal number.  It's normal in both base 10 and base 2.\n\n### OK, the interesting monkey bits\n\nA normal number will have a finite pattern (any finite pattern) occurring at the expected statistical frequency.  In other words, 0-9 will occur ten percent of the time, two digit sequences will each occur one percent of the time, etc.  Go out far enough, and a normal number will have every finite sequence at some point.  [Almost surely](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely).\n\nThis is not unlike [Infinite Monkey Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem).  Go out far enough with a random generator like a monkey, and you'll get the complete works of Shakespeare.  Some funny experiments have been tried with this.  Six Celebes Crested Macaques came up with a whole lot of \"S\" in 2003.  Some guy in 2004 came up with 19 characters from \"The Two Gentleman of Verona\" after 42 billion billion billion monkey years at the keyboard.  Not too efficient.\n\nChampernowne's is normal too, but it's constructed.  That leads to two interesting properties.  \n\nFirst, it's trivial to prove that every finite sequence occurs an infinite number of times.  123 occurs lexicographically as part of 1,230, 12,300, 123,000, 1,230,000...  \n\nThere are also an infinite number of finite sequences.  Although I don't have the mathematical formality to say this properly, I assume that a difference in counting methods shouldn't change on an infinite sequence.  Since we can easily map the digits of Champernowne's, they are countably infinite.  Using [Cantor's rational method](http://www.cut-the-knot.org/do_you_know/countRats.shtml), we see that an infinite number of an infinite number of finite sequences is also countably infinite.\n\n### Grand Finale\n\nHere's the really neat one (I think).  Since Champernowne's Number is constructed in a very simple way, it's easy to determine placement of at least one example of any finite sequence.   I wrote a little code to do that.\n\n12 occurs at position 14.  \n88 occurs at position 166.  \n456789 occurs at position 2629624.  \n\nYou get the idea.  These aren't necessarily the first example, just one.  121 occurs before you get to 120121122, for example.\n\nLet's try some strings next, using the base 2 Champernowne's Number.\n\n\"In the

there you have it, examples of crazy strings in a normal, transcendental number.  Nevermind [illegal primes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_prime), most real numbers are normal, so most numbers contain everything ever written or said including the Bible, Shakespeare, the Quran, and your next sentence!\n\nHere's the code to do it.  Just change the base or compute as a number if you prefer.\n<script src=\"http://gist.github.com/301703.js?file=Champernowne\"></script>","html":"<h3 id=\"whatisit\">What is it?</h3>\n\n<p>Most have probably never heard of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champernowne_constant\">Champernowne's Number</a>.  I hadn't either until recently.  </p>\n\n<p>Champernowne's Number is constructed of all the integers in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order\">lexicographical order</a>.  It looks like this in base 10: <br />\n    0.123456789101112131415161718192021...\nand like this in base 2: <br />\n    0.11011100101110111100010011010...\nand on and on.</p>\n\n<p>It's interesting for a few reasons.  First, it's a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number\">transcendental number</a>.  It's also a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_number\">normal number</a> (meaning the distribution of finite sequences in the number are uniform).  It never repeats.  It was the first constructed normal number.  It's normal in both base 10 and base 2.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"oktheinterestingmonkeybits\">OK, the interesting monkey bits</h3>\n\n<p>A normal number will have a finite pattern (any finite pattern) occurring at the expected statistical frequency.  In other words, 0-9 will occur ten percent of the time, two digit sequences will each occur one percent of the time, etc.  Go out far enough, and a normal number will have every finite sequence at some point.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely\">Almost surely</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This is not unlike <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem\">Infinite Monkey Theorem</a>.  Go out far enough with a random generator like a monkey, and you'll get the complete works of Shakespeare.  Some funny experiments have been tried with this.  Six Celebes Crested Macaques came up with a whole lot of \"S\" in 2003.  Some guy in 2004 came up with 19 characters from \"The Two Gentleman of Verona\" after 42 billion billion billion monkey years at the keyboard.  Not too efficient.</p>\n\n<p>Champernowne's is normal too, but it's constructed.  That leads to two interesting properties.  </p>\n\n<p>First, it's trivial to prove that every finite sequence occurs an infinite number of times.  123 occurs lexicographically as part of 1,230, 12,300, 123,000, 1,230,000...  </p>\n\n<p>There are also an infinite number of finite sequences.  Although I don't have the mathematical formality to say this properly, I assume that a difference in counting methods shouldn't change on an infinite sequence.  Since we can easily map the digits of Champernowne's, they are countably infinite.  Using <a href=\"http://www.cut-the-knot.org/do_you_know/countRats.shtml\">Cantor's rational method</a>, we see that an infinite number of an infinite number of finite sequences is also countably infinite.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"grandfinale\">Grand Finale</h3>\n\n<p>Here's the really neat one (I think).  Since Champernowne's Number is constructed in a very simple way, it's easy to determine placement of at least one example of any finite sequence.   I wrote a little code to do that.</p>\n\n<p>12 occurs at position 14. <br />\n88 occurs at position 166. <br />\n456789 occurs at position 2629624.  </p>\n\n<p>You get the idea.  These aren't necessarily the first example, just one.  121 occurs before you get to 120121122, for example.</p>\n\n<p>Let's try some strings next, using the base 2 Champernowne's Number.</p>\n\n<p>\"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\" is the binary string\n\"01001001011011100010000001110100011010000110010100100000011000100110010101100111011010010110111001101110011010010110111001100111001000000100011101101111011001000010000001100011011100100110010101100001011101000110010101100100001000000111010001101000011001010010000001101000011001010110000101110110011001010110111001110011001000000110000101101110011001000010000001110100011010000110010100100000011001010110000101110010011101000110100000101110\"

I've never tried to think ahead so concretely, so it seemed worth a try.  These are in no particular order.\n\n### No More Wires\n**ETA: 5 years**\n\nThat's right, no more wires.  Wireless power is right around the corner.  Right now, I've got my iMac and my MBP sitting on my office desk.  Both have only a power cord.  Soon, they'll both have nothing.  Every other electronic device in the home will have nothing.  If you want to use older stuff, you'll buy a product that will wrap the cord up tight and provide an adapter to get wireless power so you can take that old thing anywhere.\n\nThis is probably most interesting for mobile devices.  No more charging things.  No more docks, no more power cords, no more car adapters.  When those devices are in your house overnight, they'll just automatically be at full power when you leave in the morning.  The drive toward longer battery life will end up being capped at a day or two of use.  Newer portables, and Apple is leading the way here with batteries and low powered chipsets, are already almost to that point now.  \n\nSo that's one debate gone.\n\nA new question is how to mediate where you get that power from.  Is it universal?  Do you have to login when you get to a new house to charge your device?  Will your neighbor drive up your monthly power bill because they're grabbing from your unsecured power network?\n\n### Global Energy Needs Will Be Solved\n**ETA: 10 years**\n\nThis one feels less true today.  There's constant uproar about coal, oil, global warming (vomit), etc.\n\nSome New Great Thing is going to come up, and it will provide for the needs of major building blocks of the world.  Countries will use it.  Cities will use it.  City blocks will use it.  Factories will use it.  Giant container ships will use it.\n\nI just wish I knew what It is.  Or Its.  I suspect It is plural.  I have some guesses though.  Thorium reactors.  Giant lasers.  Fusion.  A first step is probably adding a lot more conventional nuclear power, so I'm glad to see the US do that now.  Toshiba has developed self contained micro nuclear reactors that can power a city block.  \n\nWay back in 1900, when the population was exploding, if you would've asked people what they needed to get around in this growing world, they would've said faster horses.  They wouldn't have come up with cars.  And in the future, we won't use the technologies we have now.  It'll be something new, something different.  I don't think it will be anywhere close to implemented in 10 years either.  Just that it will exist, and the world will be driving towards using it in a big way.\n\nI'm not sure what this means for cars though.  Individual cars are too small a unit to use any of the things I mentioned.  This will be the last bastion of major uses of oil.  But I expect a majority of cars, trucks, and buses to use something other than gasoline and diesel in twenty to thirty years.  There will still be a subset of gearheads that love internal combustion engines, that will never go away.  Most of the population doesn't care.\n\nI wonder what this will mean for the OPEC economies that are oil dependent.  When the global need for oil goes away, those economies will have to adapt, and they will do it slowly.\n\n### Watts From Outer Space\n**ETA: 75 years**\n\nWhen I put \"No Wires\" next to \"Abundant Global Energy\" I get some interesting infrastructure changes.\n\nPower going wireless in the next 5 years will largely comprise simple electronic appliances being disconnected from wall sockets; a futuristic convenience.  Looking forward, large amounts of research will be done to extend the useful range, to send it through the atmosphere, to increase the wattage, and to apply it in such a way that it's measurable (or more precisely, that it can be metered).\n\nOnce a sustainable fusion/thorium/laser reactor can be produced, there's no point wasting valuable Earthly real estate and resources.  Let's send that sucker up into orbit and beam our power back down.\n\nOur grandchildren will get their watts from outer space.\n\nOnce a power source goes into orbit, lots of infrastructure changes shake out.  Almost all types of transportation can rely on that power.  The power grid disappears.  All those telephone poles, light poles, stoplights, power lines, windmills, solar panels, gas stations become superfluous.  The problem of storing nuclear waste, one of the downfalls of nuclear power, goes away - it's already in orbit, just give it an exit trajectory and let it float to the outer solar system.  \n\n### No More Mail\n**ETA: 10 years**\n\nAnd I hope it's sooner.  One of my weekly annoyances is having to run out to the mailbox and grab a big pile of printed material I don't give a shit about, sort through it, take out the one important thing, and toss the rest, shredding any 2% APR credit card deals.\n\nMail is outdated.  Most of it is wasted.  Most people I know do their correspondence, invitations, and bills online now, and we're only at the beginning of a huge shift in how we move information, all in one generation.  The first step will be a Do Not Mail list citizens can opt-in to that will disallow anonymous or junk mailers.  I can't wait.\n\nI don't think the USPS will ever go away.  It's too historically bound in our country.  Its role will just be greatly diminished.  It will be that stately old institution of the US government, gentrified much the same way railway stations feel today.  \n\nUPS and FedEx on the other hand will continue to operate and thrive.  There *is* a place for expedient delivery of goods and certain business correspondence (notarized documents, etc) until someone comes out with a teleportation scheme of course, and I don't have that on my list I'm afraid.\n\n### No More Books\n**ETA: 10 years**\n\nThe paperless shift continues.. Just as newspapers, mail, and magazines are being taken over by communication over electronic mediums, so to will books.  The process will be slower.  Newspapers are horribly positioned.  They require writing, editing and printing a massive amount of paper, and then distributing it geographically to get out today's news.  Twitter, Google, and bloggers only need to move a few electrons to get the news out.  When I saw the [cell phone picture of the US Airways plane that landed in the Hudson](http://twitpic.com/135xa) posted to Twitter before Wolf Blitzer had a chance to ramble on and show far away helicopter footage, I knew the news was doomed.  It's just too damn slow now.\n\nBook publishing has no time-to-market constraints, so there's not an urgent drive to overtake the industry.  But you can still feel the big publishing houses creaking along, looking over at their journalistic peers and wondering if there's anything they can do to stop the ubiquity of bytes.\n\nThere isn't.\n\nBooks will always exist.  Let's get that straight.  Perhaps a more appropriate title for this prediction would be \"Publishing in the future will be electronic, focused on the author's content not on the printing process, and people will read on screens not paper\".  That doesn't have the same punch though.\n\nScreens not paper: that's the gist.  The Kindle aims to replace lots of books with one easy to read screen.  It's a start.  It sounds like the iPad has similar aims as one possible use case.  They're targeting educational use as well, hoping to put textbooks on an easy to access screen instead of a 30 lb processed piece of tree.  \n\nI bet my kid's backpack will be lighter than mine was.\n\n### Moore's Law Will Hold\n**For at least ten more years**\n\nThis seems both simple and complicated at the same time.  It feels like a simple prediction because, well, Moore's Law has held since, like, forever so ten years more shouldn't be too bad.  But.. it is exponential.\n\nThe complicated part is that different people mean different things when they reference Moore's Law.  The original is that the number of transistors on single chip doubles every two years.  Most other computer technologies seem to follow similar exponential rates.  So I'll be precise.  The exponential curve for processing speed and memory will hold.  Graphene transistors are already showing huge strides in early testing.  Solid state drives will continue too.  \n\nThe numbers don't even seem that outlandish anymore.  I'm talking about processing speeds around 96 Ghz and hard drives around 32 TB.  Ok, 96 Ghz is fast.  32 TB is an obscene amount of bits.  So what?\n\nI think we're nearing a time where, for almost any single user, the performance of off the shelf components will be more than sufficient.  For almost all consumers, specs won't matter.  What will matter?  Access and availability.\n\n### Less Than 50% Market Penetration For Windows\n**ETA: 5 years**\n\nIt took awhile for this to click.  I've been reading other people's opinions of Macs, Linux, and Windows for years so I take no credit as to the originality of the following idea.\n\nThe internet killed Windows.\n\nOnce it got momentum as a personal computer, everyone used Windows because everyone used Windows.  If you wanted to hit the majority of the market with your software, you wrote it for Windows.\n\nThe internet now is a universal platform on which apps can be built and run.  That means you can build it in any language you want, in any IDE you want, with any libraries you want.  As long as it renders in the web stack that a browser can render (bear with me here), your potential audience is basically the entire computer-using world.\n\nBut why does that kill Windows?  Windows sucks for development.  Shitty command line ability.  Shitty language runtimes.  Shitty proprietary APIs.  Proprietary IDE environments.  The smart people that wanted to hit the whole computer-using world wanted to use good technology, because they were smart.  That wasn't a huge percentage of users, but it was the most important slice.  Once they were gone, it was only a matter of time.\n\nOn OSX, right now, in my terminal, I've got /usr/bin/ruby, /usr/bin/perl, /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/java to choose from, along with all their documentation and all sorts of other crap.  I know what version they are because I can sit on the command line and type 'ruby -version' and find out.  I know what methods String has in ruby, because I can run irb and type 'String.methods'.  I can find processes with 'ps aux | grep processname'.  I know I *can* run all these things on Windows, but what a hassle it can be, so why bother?  \n\nThe smartest thing Apple ever did for Macs was build OSX on a flavor of Unix.  Apple combined Unix with an unflinching desire for solid design principles and captured the most important slice of users out there.\n\n### Most People Will See A Computer As An Information (or Internet) Appliance\n**ETA: 5 years**\n\nSo starting with Unix was the best decision Apple made for Macs.  The best realization Apple has made as a computer company is that most people don't give a shit about computers.\n\n**The best computer company in the world KNOWS that most people don't care about computers!**\n\nThe iPhone was the first real sign.  The upcoming iPad is an even more dramatic piece of evidence.  These things aren't made for geeks.  They still cater to geeks because of OSX and the design aesthetic, but they're built for normal people that just want to get shit done.\n\nMost people don't care about computers.  That's the weirdest thing in the world for a geek to say.  For the past ten or fifteen years they've had to care, and now, finally, there's a glimmer of hope that maybe they won't have to soon.  The user experience that the iPad offers is that glimpse.  The computer - the RAM, processor, hard drive, wires, screen, login, antivirus, operating system, CD/DVD drive, even the mouse - all that crap is out of the way.  They hit one button and get their email, hit another and their kid writes a paper for school, another and Facebook pops up, another and Google finds the instructions they need for that Bobby Flay recipe.\n\nThe iPad is the first real computer that can do that.  By real, I mean not a total piece of shit.\n\n### New Display And Input Methods\n*** 5-10 years ***\n\nPackaging in the computer industry is important for two reasons: input devices and screens.  Laptops, phones, and all-in-one computers are all packaged around either the keyboard or the screen.  If a multitouch, readable screen was not necessary, I'll bet the iPhone could fit on my keychain.  \n\nSomething, I wish I knew what, is going to keep this change going.  Multitouch is only the beginning.  Think [bendable](http://gizmodo.com/315097/samsung-demos-worlds-first-bendable-oled-screen), transparent screens.  Think [air multitouch](http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/pattie_maes_demos_the_sixth_sense.html), where any surface becomes the screen.  Think [holography](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx3TSQul94E).  I bet embedded HUD displays could follow, overlaying info over exactly what you see.  After a couple Gooogles, it sounds like [augmented reality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality) is the new hot buzzword.  Pick your poison.\n\n\nThat's all I got.  The Future's pretty cool!  Boom de yada!  Boom de yada!\n\n<img src=\"http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/xkcd_loves_the_discovery_channel.png\" title=\"I love the title-text!\" alt=\"xkcd Loves the Discovery Channel\" />","html":"<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostradamus\">All</a> <a href=\"http://baetzler.de/humor/predictions.html\">sorts</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws\">of</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions_made_by_Raymond_Kurzweil\">people</a> <a href=\"http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/ten-predictions\">do</a> <a href=\"http://www.longbets.org/\">predictions</a>.

One of my weekly annoyances is having to run out to the mailbox and grab a big pile of printed material I don't give a shit about, sort through it, take out the one important thing, and toss the rest, shredding any 2% APR credit card deals.</p>\n\n<p>Mail is outdated.  Most of it is wasted.

Just as newspapers, mail, and magazines are being taken over by communication over electronic mediums, so to will books.  The process will be slower.  Newspapers are horribly positioned.  They require writing, editing and printing a massive amount of paper, and then distributing it geographically to get out today's news.  Twitter, Google, and bloggers only need to move a few electrons to get the news out.  When I saw the <a href=\"http://twitpic.com/135xa\">cell phone picture of the US Airways plane that landed in the Hudson</a> posted to Twitter before Wolf Blitzer had a chance to ramble on and show far away helicopter footage, I knew the news was doomed.  It's just too damn slow now.</p>\n\n<p>Book publishing has no time-to-market constraints, so there's not an urgent drive to overtake the industry.  But you can still feel the big publishing houses creaking along, looking over at their journalistic peers and wondering if there's anything they can do to stop the ubiquity of bytes.</p>\n\n<p>There isn't.</p>\n\n<p>Books will always exist.  Let's get that straight.  Perhaps a more appropriate title for this prediction would be \"Publishing in the future will be electronic, focused on the author's content not on the printing process, and people will read on screens not paper\".  That doesn't have the same punch though.</p>\n\n<p>Screens not paper: that's the gist.  The Kindle aims to replace lots of books with one easy to read screen.  It's a start.  It sounds like the iPad has similar aims as one possible use case.  They're targeting educational use as well, hoping to put textbooks on an easy to access screen instead of a 30 lb processed piece of tree.  </p>\n\n<p>I bet my kid's backpack will be lighter than mine was.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mooreslawwillhold\">Moore's Law Will Hold</h3>\n\n<p><strong>For at least ten more years</strong></p>\n\n<p>This seems both simple and complicated at the same time.

But.. it is exponential.</p>\n\n<p>The complicated part is that different people mean different things when they reference Moore's Law.  The original is that the number of transistors on single chip doubles every two years.  Most other computer technologies seem to follow similar exponential rates.  So I'll be precise.  The exponential curve for processing speed and memory will hold.  Graphene transistors are already showing huge strides in early testing.  Solid state drives will continue too.  </p>\n\n<p>The numbers don't even seem that outlandish anymore.  I'm talking about processing speeds around 96 Ghz and hard drives around 32 TB.  Ok, 96 Ghz is fast.  32 TB is an obscene amount of bits.  So what?</p>\n\n<p>I think we're nearing a time where, for almost any single user, the performance of off the shelf components will be more than sufficient.

Windows sucks for development.  Shitty command line ability.  Shitty language runtimes.  Shitty proprietary APIs.  Proprietary IDE environments.

We humans have a passionate and innate desire to understand the world around us.  We seek to know whatever we can find out, and if we can't or don't think we can find out, we make up patterns.  Humans are amazing pattern seekers even when none exist.\n\nIf something is innate it means we are born with it.  Children seem to prove this.  The natural curiosity a child has as they learn language and begin to understand how the world around them works is self evident.  Adults are drawn to children's curiosity, almost mesmerized.  We wish we could carry out the same interests with the same passion.\n\nI've been discovering my views about education over the last several years and I've come to find out that I find the current education system deplorable and scary.  I don't want my kids in it.  Aside from the one or two amazing teachers a kid might find in their entire K-12 career, and that's if they are lucky, schools don't cut it.  There are many factors behind this opinion, but one particular reason really stands out.\n\nSchools take what kids *want* to know and transform it into one of two things:  \n\n1.  What they don't care about\n2.  (and worse) What they *ought* to know.\n\n### What they don't care about\n\nI'm going to talk about my own experience with school, because it's the most immediate experience available.  But I think a similar case could be made for 98% of secondary education students out there.  The proof is in their constantly bored faces and general teenage disinterest.  Those characteristics are made, not bred.\n\nDuring school, I didn't care about a lot of things.  I detested history class, hated most poetry, thought that \"literature\" was boring, and that [the essay](http://paulgraham.com/essay.html) was an antiquated method of attempting to sound smart while repetitively saying nothing at all.  I thought language classes were boring and the cultures they taught were uninteresting.  Computer Science class was a joke.  Chemistry class was droll.  Biology class held only a minor interest, and that was probably only because it was cool that someone dropped a pig brain on the floor.  \n\nYet in my free time I couldn't get my head out of a book.  I loved Poe.  Marine biology was, I thought, my future profession.  Like most kids, I loved dinosaurs.  I read about Newton and his ridiculous, apocryphal apple.  I tried to make up experiments to determine the amount of light required for the human eye to discern wavelengths of color.\n\nI still can't get my head out of a book.  I write code in my free time, away from work.  I love math problems and puzzles.  Ancient Greek and Roman history fascinates me, as does the Renaissance.  Poetry amazes me, art excites me, and classical music is the one genre I wouldn't give up on a desert island.\n\nI've read or studied the same things from school later on and found myself captivated.  Why the difference?  The subjects haven't changed, although selections might appeal more or less to different people.  So I can only conclude that the difference lies in the manner in which the subjects were approached.\n\nThis may or may not have to do directly with teachers.  Variability exists, but teachers often don't start with the source material they're teaching.  They start with a lesson plan.  Barry Schwartz provides a great example of a horrible curricula in his [TED Talk on the loss of wisdom](http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_our_loss_of_wisdom.html).  He describes a 75-point lesson plan for reading a 25 page kindergarten book:\n\"All over Chicago, every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day ... Scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster.  And they present disaster.  But what they assure in its place is mediocrity.\"\n\t\nTo anyone above the median, mediocrity is slow.  Worse than slow; mediocrity is a death knell.  The damage of a moderate pace of learning to someone in the 90th or 99th percentile is a sort of smothering effect.  They think, \"is this it?  Is this what I have to look forward to?\"  It's from a history of this kind that Einstein said \"It is in fact nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry.\"\n\t\nKids want to learn.  More than anything else, learning requires a curious mind and a sense of wonder.  By locking down the curriculum tightly or teaching without a [sense of wonder](http://lifeaftersunday.com/purification-stage/wonder), we are abandoning our children to a world of grey; colorless and seemingly absent of the subject of that innate passion they have felt all their lives.\n\n### What they ought to know\n\nSomewhere along the line in school, like many people, I realized that this style of education was a [sort of facade](http://paulgraham.com/nerds.html).  I don't think I really understood this directly, but there was an itch in my brain.  Every teacher seemed to follow directly [the textbook](http://www.edutopia.org/muddle-machine) they had.  If their interest in the subject was so keen and their knowledge so crisp that they could teach it to us, why such a direct association?  Surely there was other material out there?\n\nAnd there is.  American history doesn't boil down to 4 or 5 important dates and 7 or 8 important people.  It's a mosaic with many subplots, twists, and figures.  The only place this facade didn't exist was math class.  My calculus teacher used to move on to each new subject by grandiosely introducing \"the picture [in the book] that has nothing to do with the chapter\".  Then we'd close our book and do his math.  He seemed to keep the textbook only because he had to and we revered him for that.  He used to say you needed to take calculus three times and teach it twice before you really understood it.  Under his guidance, I think half the class understood it the first time.  We all aced the AP test.\n\nOf the lucky students that have a glimpse through the doldrums of American secondary education, I think a vast majority of them get it from math.  Science is probably second.  There's a simple reason: you have to be able to _do_ math.  If you don't understand Heathcliff's symbolism in Wuthering Heights, you can look in the Cliff Notes whether you're a student or a teacher.  But if you're trying to solve a math problem in front of a class and you can't do it, you're going to look like an idiot.\n\n(Hopefully college lets more people get some real education.  That's the idea anyway, I have my doubts whether or not it works.  But at least more professors seem to ask real questions and know the topics beyond a textbook understanding.  They have to - they're usually required to do research in their field.)\n\nThe interesting effect of this whole facade is that most kids go through school with the expectation that their teacher knows the answer and they don't.  The teachers try to uphold this; they are the authority after all.  The student's _job_ is to _learn_ the answer, sometimes simply by guessing \"D\" on a Scantron.\n\nA method of learning that involves guessing, picking answers out of the air is frightening.  Because of this system, most people consider an answer to be a sort of *a priori* Platonic ideal, floating out there in the aether.  All they need to do is reach out and grab the right thing.\n\nThis is, of course, bullshit.  Nobody, not a single person that has invented or discovered something has ever thought of the \"right answer\" like that.  Think about Newton, Einstein, Edison, Austen, Shakespeare.  They were ambitious, excited, and above all curious.  They were having fun.  Playing.  Up until a certain age in school, maybe 8-10, that's what kids do too.  They play.  \n\nAs [Ken Robinson notes](http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html), we're educating kids for a world that doesn't exist yet, for jobs that don't exist yet.  They will be [inventing the future](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay).  It's scary to consider the decisions that today's kids will make later on because they get into a situation where they are *supposed* to know the answer.  [They'll be glib](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/04/when_only_the_g.html).\n\nI love what Kathy Sierra notes in the above article: in most situations, the fast talkers win.  Not because they're right, but because they come up with a potential answer fastest.  That's an increasing trend.  The push from pen and paper to email to texting and Twitter is evidence of the same kind of problem.  The speed of communication, for us humans, seems to be a subconscious cue of intelligence.\n\nGlibness often matches up with a certain lack of intuition.  In math class, if you \"got it\", if you understood the concept, you didn't need to memorize all those chalkboard formulas.  It wasn't a definitions sheet you had to regurgitate on a test.  If you really got it and you didn't know the formula, you could always just re-derive it anyway.  It was the concept that mattered.\n\nThat's what made me realize that all the geniuses in the world aren't all that amazing either.  Biographers and other people in the field have a vested interest in garnering amazement.  In some cases like Einstein, Newton, Euler, and Shakespeare it's impossible not to be in awe, you can't change that.  \n\nYet... All proclaimed geniuses are very competent, but there's lots of competent people out there.  What set them apart was the combination of competence and intuition.  It wasn't that they could do the problems right, the difference maker was the ability to [grok](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok) the concepts.  And that allowed them to come up with new questions, and new answers.\n\nAt best, the amazing people of the world have maybe one skillful discriminator.  Maybe they're on the + side of the 5 + or - 2 items one can hold in one's head (if there's anything, this is probably my useful quirk that let's me make up slightly for poor intuition).  But no amount of skill alone will transform a lack of intuition.  That's the real key to the understanding that makes men into giants.\n\nIf I were a teacher, I think I'd be a miserable one for covering material.  That's how most teaching works, information gets nuggetized into little bits that we can memorize, and this set of memorizations becomes our patent knowledge of the subject.  But a compound set of information about some thing is not the same as really understanding that thing.\n\nInstead, I'd be more interested in the wall of understanding - the intuition breakthrough - that let's someone really get it.  Once you have that, a new subject comes and you learn it and grok it.  The nuggets are still important, but they take on a new meaning when you get where they're coming from.  Plus they become easier to memorize, because you have the context that they apply to.\n\nThat nuggetization (God, what a word) is one of the biggest problems now.  The pace of our information ingest keeps increasing, forcing us to nuggetize more and more.  In school and at work, nuggetization is an attempt to be able to say \"Yes! Person X comprehensively understands material Y.\"  What a load of crap.  SATs, Scantrons, Process, Methodology - all those logical, rational things we teach in math and the sciences.  It's all the same thing: an attempt to provide a base level of understanding about a subject when a person lacks intuition for it.  \n\nMaybe instead we ought to focus on understanding how to cultivate that intuition.  That will only start with a sense of wonder.\n\n### A Theory: Listen to People Who Listen\n\nIf most people tend towards being glib, and school tends toward nuggetization, what do we do?  Outside of books, who do we learn from?\n\nMy theory is to listen to people who listen.\n\nThat means in the converse to ignore talkers.  Often the people that talk the most seem to say the least.  By this I don't mean that extraverts say less than introverts.  Rather, if you talk the fastest, necessarily you're thinking less than the people who might talk slower.  Our brains are more or less serial processes.\n\nIt's true that extraverts often think by talking things out.  I don't have a problem with that.  But because of our education teaching us that we ought to know the a priori answer, whether those fast talkers are right or not, the first proposed answer tends to stick.\n\nThe deeper problem is all of the learning that has led up to the fast talking.  When you talk fast, you can't really listen.\n\nConsider a person as a function of input and output.  As children, our rate of input is astronomically high, based on that passion and sense of wonder I mentioned before.  Rate of meaningful output is low, and the quality of that output is low.  This is expected, as the purpose of the output is practice and learning.  As we grow older, input will decrease - it has to somewhat.  Output will increase too, along with (hopefully) the quality.\n\nThe trick is to let this trend slowly.  Someone who limits their input too much cannot possibly be maximizing their learning as much as someone who holds input as paramount.  So by default their output is less informed.  It has to be, they don't have as much data - as much experience and learning - to base their output on.\n\nIf you were to graph this, I'd expect the typical input function of a person to trend downward rapidly and level out somewhere just above zero.  Output would continue to increase.  Quality of output would asymptote out somewhere too.\n\nI'd rather see an input curve that stayed higher.  There's some imaginary line of input somewhere that allows the graph of quality of output to continue steadily increasing, rather than hit a wall.\n\nYou can see the difference in people.  Most people allow their skill and ability at tasks (their output) to reach a certain point at which they're happy.  They feel sufficiently competent.  They may even *be* sufficiently competent.  Think of the adults around that are \"stuck in their ways\" and contrast them with those happy few that always seem to pick up some little nuance, some little extra that continues to transform the way they do things.  These people are never satisfied and are always searching.\n\nThose are the people I want to listen to - the ones who keep listening.  They don't stagnate, their conformity is negligible (meaning they care little about both conforming and not conforming), and their output, both quality and quantity, can be mindbending.  That's an important caveat: you should still produce output.  Despite the precedence of input over output, the output of those types of folks is amazingly high.\n\n### Boring and Stupid\n\nThis path of reasoning began with a simple assumption: that we want to know everything we can.  That's a glaring error.  I forgot to deal with the base case.  \n\nNot everyone wants to know everything.  Most people are happy with their misconceptions.  Through the joys of [Dunning-Kruger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect), they think they are smart enough.  Break them, let them know their error and they'll get angry.  Riotous.  \n\nAwhile ago, I was heading back to work from lunch, and I followed a remarkably slow van merging onto the highway.  He did about 30 mph the whole time and barely made it into the slow lane.  The several cars stacked behind him had a mess trying to merge, and I'm sure the problem percolated backwards on the highway to cause a general slowdown.  As I passed him, finally going close to the speed of the flow of traffic, I looked over and thought, \"how stupid can you get?\"\n\nI immediately felt guilty.  It was an unfair assumption.  We shouldn't think of people as stupid, he was just making a mistake.  Or having a bad hair day.  Or something.  Right?\n\nThere are lots of different kinds of stupid.  It's more of a vector than a scalar, just like intelligence.  I think we can categorize them into a few types:\n\n - Unable to comprehend\n - Unable or unwilling to adapt to new ideas\n - False assumptions\n - Contentedly oblivious\n - Conformist to certain ideas\n - Intentionally non-conformist or contrarian\n\nThere may be others, but most examples of stupidity can be bucketed into these types.  \n\nThere's one really easy correlation for stupidity: boring.  Stupid and boring go together an amazing amount of time.  Think about the most boring possible scene in the family room of a house, the fruits of the owner's boring hobbies spread around, sitting on their boring, average couch, with boring knickknacks sitting on boring doilies.  I'll bet you think they're pretty stupid.  Now think about spending an hour in a room with someone you consider awfully stupid.  I'll bet you'd be bored.\n\nThe correlation between stupid and boring has the feel of truth around it despite lacking hard evidence.  If we consider knowledge as truths - facts, understanding of reality and perception, etc. - someone stupid has less of it than someone not stupid.  Based on my list they either don't care to know, don't want to know, refuse to know, or can't know.  And because of the same natural curiosity that drives us as children but that we must actively work to retain as adults, less knowledge is boring.\n\nLet's go back to my friend driving slow in the van.  A widely held perception is that \"SPEED KILLS\".  I'm sure you've seen the bumper stickers.  They're right next to the one that says \"Troopers are your best protection\". (YOU, the driver, are your own best protection.)\n\nLet's dissect that, shall we?  In an accident, regardless of your rate of speed or cause, you are absolutely fine until impact.  Therefore, I posit that what actually kills is speed deltas.  Changes in speed.  A constant velocity, no matter how fast, is perfectly safe.  Airliners travel at 590 mph all day long, their occupants napping and eating peanuts.  That's a much different truth than the simulated truth on the bumper sticker \"SPEED KILLS\", which is both boring and very stupid.\n\nConsider some situations.  Going too fast on the highway, say 15 mph more than the general flow of traffic, is dangerous.  An accident would cause considerable damage.  Problems with reactions to changing situations also arise.  Going too slow then is also dangerous.  A constant flow of traffic traveling at 70 mph will have the same problems to a car going 50 mph: an accident would cause considerable damage and problems with reactions to changing situations arise.\n\nWe can conclude then that, despite seeming more innocuous than the maniac doing 90mph down a highway, the idiot van merging into 70 mph traffic at 40 mph is also extremely dangerous.  In fact, most people would agree that slower drivers react more slowly and are less capable of accident avoidance.  That maniac doing 90 mph is usually at least aware of the surroundings and capable of reacting quickly.  I'll take someone going too fast over someone going too slow in most situations.\n\nThe distinction that speed *deltas* kill would change lots of other circumstances on our highway.  Rules about lane changes and overtaking on the right would be understood and enforced.  Speed limits could often be far higher providing that all traffic followed them.

At least she didn't refuse the expert, as some on the show have done.\n\nThat poor woman is stupid *because* she has no idea what to do with her ignorance.  Just as Bossuet said the greatest weakness is the fear of appearing weak, the greatest barrier to knowledge is the fear of appearing to not know.  Rick Harrison knows how to not know.  We'll never know everything, so we should educate our kids towards the goal of knowing how to not know, and give them the tools to ask questions.","html":"<h3 id=\"whatwewanttoknow\">What We Want To Know</h3>\n\n<p>What we want to know, I think, is everything.  We humans have a passionate and innate desire to understand the world around us.  We seek to know whatever we can find out, and if we can't or don't think we can find out, we make up patterns.  Humans are amazing pattern seekers even when none exist.</p>\n\n<p>If something is innate it means we are born with it.  Children seem to prove this.  The natural curiosity a child has as they learn language and begin to understand how the world around them works is self evident.  Adults are drawn to children's curiosity, almost mesmerized.  We wish we could carry out the same interests with the same passion.</p>\n\n<p>I've been discovering my views about education over the last several years and I've come to find out that I find the current education system deplorable and scary.  I don't want my kids in it.  Aside from the one or two amazing teachers a kid might find in their entire K-12 career, and that's if they are lucky, schools don't cut it.  There are many factors behind this opinion, but one particular reason really stands out.</p>\n\n<p>Schools take what kids <em>want</em> to know and transform it into one of two things:  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What they don't care about  </li>\n<li>(and worse) What they <em>ought</em> to know.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"whattheydontcareabout\">What they don't care about</h3>\n\n<p>I'm going to talk about my own experience with school, because it's the most immediate experience available.  But I think a similar case could be made for 98% of secondary education students out there.  The proof is in their constantly bored faces and general teenage disinterest.  Those characteristics are made, not bred.</p>\n\n<p>During school, I didn't care about a lot of things.  I detested history class, hated most poetry, thought that \"literature\" was boring, and that <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/essay.html\">the essay</a> was an antiquated method of attempting to sound smart while repetitively saying nothing at all.  I thought language classes were boring and the cultures they taught were uninteresting.  Computer Science class was a joke.  Chemistry class was droll.  Biology class held only a minor interest, and that was probably only because it was cool that someone dropped a pig brain on the floor.  </p>\n\n<p>Yet in my free time I couldn't get my head out of a book.  I loved Poe.  Marine biology was, I thought, my future profession.  Like most kids, I loved dinosaurs.  I read about Newton and his ridiculous, apocryphal apple.  I tried to make up experiments to determine the amount of light required for the human eye to discern wavelengths of color.</p>\n\n<p>I still can't get my head out of a book.  I write code in my free time, away from work.  I love math problems and puzzles.  Ancient Greek and Roman history fascinates me, as does the Renaissance.  Poetry amazes me, art excites me, and classical music is the one genre I wouldn't give up on a desert island.</p>\n\n<p>I've read or studied the same things from school later on and found myself captivated.  Why the difference?  The subjects haven't changed, although selections might appeal more or less to different people.  So I can only conclude that the difference lies in the manner in which the subjects were approached.</p>\n\n<p>This may or may not have to do directly with teachers.  Variability exists, but teachers often don't start with the source material they're teaching.  They start with a lesson plan.  Barry Schwartz provides a great example of a horrible curricula in his <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_our_loss_of_wisdom.html\">TED Talk on the loss of wisdom</a>.  He describes a 75-point lesson plan for reading a 25 page kindergarten book: <br />\n\"All over Chicago, every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day ... Scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster.  And they present disaster.  But what they assure in its place is mediocrity.\"</p>\n\n<p>To anyone above the median, mediocrity is slow.  Worse than slow; mediocrity is a death knell.  The damage of a moderate pace of learning to someone in the 90th or 99th percentile is a sort of smothering effect.  They think, \"is this it?  Is this what I have to look forward to?\"  It's from a history of this kind that Einstein said \"It is in fact nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry.\"</p>\n\n<p>Kids want to learn.  More than anything else, learning requires a curious mind and a sense of wonder.  By locking down the curriculum tightly or teaching without a <a href=\"http://lifeaftersunday.com/purification-stage/wonder\">sense of wonder</a>, we are abandoning our children to a world of grey; colorless and seemingly absent of the subject of that innate passion they have felt all their lives.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"whattheyoughttoknow\">What they ought to know</h3>\n\n<p>Somewhere along the line in school, like many people, I realized that this style of education was a <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/nerds.html\">sort of facade</a>.  I don't think I really understood this directly, but there was an itch in my brain.  Every teacher seemed to follow directly <a href=\"http://www.edutopia.org/muddle-machine\">the textbook</a> they had.  If their interest in the subject was so keen and their knowledge so crisp that they could teach it to us, why such a direct association?  Surely there was other material out there?</p>\n\n<p>And there is.  American history doesn't boil down to 4 or 5 important dates and 7 or 8 important people.  It's a mosaic with many subplots, twists, and figures.  The only place this facade didn't exist was math class.  My calculus teacher used to move on to each new subject by grandiosely introducing \"the picture [in the book] that has nothing to do with the chapter\".  Then we'd close our book and do his math.  He seemed to keep the textbook only because he had to and we revered him for that.  He used to say you needed to take calculus three times and teach it twice before you really understood it.  Under his guidance, I think half the class understood it the first time.  We all aced the AP test.</p>\n\n<p>Of the lucky students that have a glimpse through the doldrums of American secondary education, I think a vast majority of them get it from math.  Science is probably second.  There's a simple reason: you have to be able to <em>do</em> math.  If you don't understand Heathcliff's symbolism in Wuthering Heights, you can look in the Cliff Notes whether you're a student or a teacher.  But if you're trying to solve a math problem in front of a class and you can't do it, you're going to look like an idiot.</p>\n\n<p>(Hopefully college lets more people get some real education.  That's the idea anyway, I have my doubts whether or not it works.  But at least more professors seem to ask real questions and know the topics beyond a textbook understanding.  They have to - they're usually required to do research in their field.)</p>\n\n<p>The interesting effect of this whole facade is that most kids go through school with the expectation that their teacher knows the answer and they don't.  The teachers try to uphold this; they are the authority after all.  The student's <em>job</em> is to <em>learn</em> the answer, sometimes simply by guessing \"D\" on a Scantron.</p>\n\n<p>A method of learning that involves guessing, picking answers out of the air is frightening.  Because of this system, most people consider an answer to be a sort of <em>a priori</em> Platonic ideal, floating out there in the aether.  All they need to do is reach out and grab the right thing.</p>\n\n<p>This is, of course, bullshit.  Nobody, not a single person that has invented or discovered something has ever thought of the \"right answer\" like that.  Think about Newton, Einstein, Edison, Austen, Shakespeare.  They were ambitious, excited, and above all curious.  They were having fun.  Playing.  Up until a certain age in school, maybe 8-10, that's what kids do too.  They play.  </p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html\">Ken Robinson notes</a>, we're educating kids for a world that doesn't exist yet, for jobs that don't exist yet.  They will be <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay\">inventing the future</a>.  It's scary to consider the decisions that today's kids will make later on because they get into a situation where they are <em>supposed</em> to know the answer.  <a href=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/04/when_only_the_g.html\">They'll be glib</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I love what Kathy Sierra notes in the above article: in most situations, the fast talkers win.  Not because they're right, but because they come up with a potential answer fastest.  That's an increasing trend.  The push from pen and paper to email to texting and Twitter is evidence of the same kind of problem.  The speed of communication, for us humans, seems to be a subconscious cue of intelligence.</p>\n\n<p>Glibness often matches up with a certain lack of intuition.  In math class, if you \"got it\", if you understood the concept, you didn't need to memorize all those chalkboard formulas.  It wasn't a definitions sheet you had to regurgitate on a test.  If you really got it and you didn't know the formula, you could always just re-derive it anyway.  It was the concept that mattered.</p>\n\n<p>That's what made me realize that all the geniuses in the world aren't all that amazing either.  Biographers and other people in the field have a vested interest in garnering amazement.  In some cases like Einstein, Newton, Euler, and Shakespeare it's impossible not to be in awe, you can't change that.  </p>\n\n<p>Yet... All proclaimed geniuses are very competent, but there's lots of competent people out there.  What set them apart was the combination of competence and intuition.  It wasn't that they could do the problems right, the difference maker was the ability to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok\">grok</a> the concepts.  And that allowed them to come up with new questions, and new answers.</p>\n\n<p>At best, the amazing people of the world have maybe one skillful discriminator.  Maybe they're on the + side of the 5 + or - 2 items one can hold in one's head (if there's anything, this is probably my useful quirk that let's me make up slightly for poor intuition).  But no amount of skill alone will transform a lack of intuition.  That's the real key to the understanding that makes men into giants.</p>\n\n<p>If I were a teacher, I think I'd be a miserable one for covering material.  That's how most teaching works, information gets nuggetized into little bits that we can memorize, and this set of memorizations becomes our patent knowledge of the subject.  But a compound set of information about some thing is not the same as really understanding that thing.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, I'd be more interested in the wall of understanding - the intuition breakthrough - that let's someone really get it.  Once you have that, a new subject comes and you learn it and grok it.  The nuggets are still important, but they take on a new meaning when you get where they're coming from.  Plus they become easier to memorize, because you have the context that they apply to.</p>\n\n<p>That nuggetization (God, what a word) is one of the biggest problems now.  The pace of our information ingest keeps increasing, forcing us to nuggetize more and more.  In school and at work, nuggetization is an attempt to be able to say \"Yes! Person X comprehensively understands material Y.\"  What a load of crap.  SATs, Scantrons, Process, Methodology - all those logical, rational things we teach in math and the sciences.  It's all the same thing: an attempt to provide a base level of understanding about a subject when a person lacks intuition for it.  </p>\n\n<p>Maybe instead we ought to focus on understanding how to cultivate that intuition.  That will only start with a sense of wonder.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"atheorylistentopeoplewholisten\">A Theory: Listen to People Who Listen</h3>\n\n<p>If most people tend towards being glib, and school tends toward nuggetization, what do we do?  Outside of books, who do we learn from?</p>\n\n<p>My theory is to listen to people who listen.</p>\n\n<p>That means in the converse to ignore talkers.  Often the people that talk the most seem to say the least.  By this I don't mean that extraverts say less than introverts.  Rather, if you talk the fastest, necessarily you're thinking less than the people who might talk slower.  Our brains are more or less serial processes.</p>\n\n<p>It's true that extraverts often think by talking things out.  I don't have a problem with that.  But because of our education teaching us that we ought to know the a priori answer, whether those fast talkers are right or not, the first proposed answer tends to stick.</p>\n\n<p>The deeper problem is all of the learning that has led up to the fast talking.  When you talk fast, you can't really listen.</p>\n\n<p>Consider a person as a function of input and output.  As children, our rate of input is astronomically high, based on that passion and sense of wonder I mentioned before.  Rate of meaningful output is low, and the quality of that output is low.  This is expected, as the purpose of the output is practice and learning.  As we grow older, input will decrease - it has to somewhat.  Output will increase too, along with (hopefully) the quality.</p>\n\n<p>The trick is to let this trend slowly.  Someone who limits their input too much cannot possibly be maximizing their learning as much as someone who holds input as paramount.  So by default their output is less informed.  It has to be, they don't have as much data - as much experience and learning - to base their output on.</p>\n\n<p>If you were to graph this, I'd expect the typical input function of a person to trend downward rapidly and level out somewhere just above zero.  Output would continue to increase.  Quality of output would asymptote out somewhere too.</p>\n\n<p>I'd rather see an input curve that stayed higher.  There's some imaginary line of input somewhere that allows the graph of quality of output to continue steadily increasing, rather than hit a wall.</p>\n\n<p>You can see the difference in people.  Most people allow their skill and ability at tasks (their output) to reach a certain point at which they're happy.  They feel sufficiently competent.  They may even <em>be</em> sufficiently competent.  Think of the adults around that are \"stuck in their ways\" and contrast them with those happy few that always seem to pick up some little nuance, some little extra that continues to transform the way they do things.  These people are never satisfied and are always searching.</p>\n\n<p>Those are the people I want to listen to - the ones who keep listening.  They don't stagnate, their conformity is negligible (meaning they care little about both conforming and not conforming), and their output, both quality and quantity, can be mindbending.  That's an important caveat: you should still produce output.  Despite the precedence of input over output, the output of those types of folks is amazingly high.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"boringandstupid\">Boring and Stupid</h3>\n\n<p>This path of reasoning began with a simple assumption: that we want to know everything we can.  That's a glaring error.  I forgot to deal with the base case.  </p>\n\n<p>Not everyone wants to know everything.  Most people are happy with their misconceptions.  Through the joys of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect\">Dunning-Kruger</a>, they think they are smart enough.  Break them, let them know their error and they'll get angry.  Riotous.  </p>\n\n<p>Awhile ago, I was heading back to work from lunch, and I followed a remarkably slow van merging onto the highway.  He did about 30 mph the whole time and barely made it into the slow lane.  The several cars stacked behind him had a mess trying to merge, and I'm sure the problem percolated backwards on the highway to cause a general slowdown.  As I passed him, finally going close to the speed of the flow of traffic, I looked over and thought, \"how stupid can you get?\"</p>\n\n<p>I immediately felt guilty.  It was an unfair assumption.  We shouldn't think of people as stupid, he was just making a mistake.  Or having a bad hair day.  Or something.  Right?</p>\n\n<p>There are lots of different kinds of stupid.  It's more of a vector than a scalar, just like intelligence.  I think we can categorize them into a few types:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Unable to comprehend</li>\n<li>Unable or unwilling to adapt to new ideas</li>\n<li>False assumptions</li>\n<li>Contentedly oblivious</li>\n<li>Conformist to certain ideas</li>\n<li>Intentionally non-conformist or contrarian</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There may be others, but most examples of stupidity can be bucketed into these types.  </p>\n\n<p>There's one really easy correlation for stupidity: boring.  Stupid and boring go together an amazing amount of time.  Think about the most boring possible scene in the family room of a house, the fruits of the owner's boring hobbies spread around, sitting on their boring, average couch, with boring knickknacks sitting on boring doilies.  I'll bet you think they're pretty stupid.  Now think about spending an hour in a room with someone you consider awfully stupid.  I'll bet you'd be bored.</p>\n\n<p>The correlation between stupid and boring has the feel of truth around it despite lacking hard evidence.  If we consider knowledge as truths - facts, understanding of reality and perception, etc. - someone stupid has less of it than someone not stupid.  Based on my list they either don't care to know, don't want to know, refuse to know, or can't know.  And because of the same natural curiosity that drives us as children but that we must actively work to retain as adults, less knowledge is boring.</p>\n\n<p>Let's go back to my friend driving slow in the van.  A widely held perception is that \"SPEED KILLS\".  I'm sure you've seen the bumper stickers.  They're right next to the one that says \"Troopers are your best protection\". (YOU, the driver, are your own best protection.)</p>\n\n<p>Let's dissect that, shall we?  In an accident, regardless of your rate of speed or cause, you are absolutely fine until impact.  Therefore, I posit that what actually kills is speed deltas.  Changes in speed.  A constant velocity, no matter how fast, is perfectly safe.  Airliners travel at 590 mph all day long, their occupants napping and eating peanuts.  That's a much different truth than the simulated truth on the bumper sticker \"SPEED KILLS\", which is both boring and very stupid.</p>\n\n<p>Consider some situations.  Going too fast on the highway, say 15 mph more than the general flow of traffic, is dangerous.  An accident would cause considerable damage.  Problems with reactions to changing situations also arise.  Going too slow then is also dangerous.  A constant flow of traffic traveling at 70 mph will have the same problems to a car going 50 mph: an accident would cause considerable damage and problems with reactions to changing situations arise.</p>\n\n<p>We can conclude then that, despite seeming more innocuous than the maniac doing 90mph down a highway, the idiot van merging into 70 mph traffic at 40 mph is also extremely dangerous.  In fact, most people would agree that slower drivers react more slowly and are less capable of accident avoidance.  That maniac doing 90 mph is usually at least aware of the surroundings and capable of reacting quickly.  I'll take someone going too fast over someone going too slow in most situations.</p>\n\n<p>The distinction that speed <em>deltas</em> kill would change lots of other circumstances on our highway.  Rules about lane changes and overtaking on the right would be understood and enforced.  Speed limits could often be far higher providing that all traffic followed them.  On ramps would not be decreasing radius turns forcing cars to their slowest speed right before entering highway traffic.  On ramps would consistently merge into the slowest, rightmost lane of traffic, rather than merging into the fast lane at the convenience of the construction plan.  </p>\n\n<p>Come to think of it, this sounds like German highways, well known for their <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobahn#Germany_4\">autobahns</a> and low incidence rate of fatal accidents.  But most people just don't get it.</p>\n\n<p>When I thought about all of this, my guilt at thinking this guy was stupid lessened.  (I thought he looked boring too.)  I didn't think he was simply making a mistake either.  There's a huge difference between being stupid and making mistakes.  It wasn't a mistake to him, he wasn't distracted by talking on the phone.

It's an experiment in trying to be more mobile.  My goal is to find out if it can replace my laptop.  I have my doubts so far, but it's worth a shot.  My main concern has been input.\n\n### Desks\n\nI'm writing this on my iMac.  I love the iMac.  It's a giant floating screen filled with awesome.  The utility of Unix is there, lurking just beneath the surface, but in general the \"computer\" part of things has been abstracted away leaving only a gorgeous screen filled with pixels, speakers, a wireless keyboard and a tiny wireless mouse.\n\nThe keyboard and the mouse are the problem.  For a long time, I strongly kept to Apple's design aesthetic.  My home office continues their design theme: grey, black and white with the occasional splash of color; clean lines, sparse usage.  Everything is in its place and the main desk area has been largely empty save for the iMac, an Apple keyboard, an Apple mouse, and a wire heading down to the hidden backup drives.  Quiet, sparse, minimalist but well designed and functional.  Until recently.\n\nMy desk has changed.  I've still got the big iMac sitting in the middle, but it's surrounded by a bit more stuff.  I'm now writing on a wired Microsoft Natural Keyboard 4000 (I almost pulled out my old school 1984 IBM keyboard, but a natural is just so nice), with a Microsoft IntelliPoint wired laser mouse (that's right, I said wired) sitting next to it on an XTrac pad.  On the other side there's a big sketchbook, pens, markers, phone, iPad, soda, and various papers and handwritten notes.\n\nMinimalism is a remarkable design aesthetic, but it's easy to take it too far.  We think of the iPhone or the iPad as very minimalist designs, but that's only true in the hardware.  Apple has removed as much hardware design as possible so that the focus is on the screen itself.  Once the screen is on, it's filled with colors, shapes and options.  It's well organized, but not very minimalistic.\n\nI started with minimalism in my office, which is far easier than starting with something more complex.  But I wasn't getting as much done.  Instead of sitting at my quiet desk, I would steal away to the basement with my laptop.  Something wasn't working.  It was too quiet.\n\nSo I added a bit back.  I ditched the wireless keyboard, which is a piece of crap for fast inputs.  I ditched the wireless Apple mouse, which is even more of a piece of crap.  I made sure that I had things I needed near me - books, a sketchpad, pens, etc.  The difference has been profound.  All of a sudden, my office feels much more usable.  It feels like home.\n\nThere's a balance between quiet and clutter.  The best designed workspace is the most usable, not the most beautiful.  This is true for both physical space, computer space, and input devices.  My desk needs some additional items.  It needs a *good* keyboard and mouse.  It needs paper and pens, because some things you just have to work out on paper.  It needs music.  My computer desktop on the other hand is very clean.  There are no gazillion files sitting on the desktop.  Everything is hierarchically ordered and, where applicable, version controlled.  On the other hand, under Expose my desktop looks like a mess.  There's something like 20 windows with tens of tabs in browsers, RSS readers and editors.  There's an interesting balance there.\n\n<img src=\"http://infiniteabyss.org/images/Desktop.png\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" />\n\n### Input\n\nBack to input devices.  Apple can clearly design remarkably beautiful and highly usable hardware.  They could do the same thing for keyboards and mice.  So why the *hell* am I using a Microsoft keyboard and mouse??\n\nThis was really confounding me until I remembered Steve Jobs at the iPad debut.  He said, \"Apple is a mobile devices company. This is what we do.\"\n\nWell, that changes things.\n\nSee, ever since around 2000, when they were dreaming up the iPod, Apple has been transforming.  When Jobs came back to Apple, they did some desktops and it got them back on the map.  But on the whole, one can look at their Mac line of computers as a side project.  Their bread and butter was the iPod (mobile music), the iPhone (mobile phone and stuff), and the iPad (mobile... computer).  That, and really damn good design.  \n\nIn fact, I would say if it weren't for the remarkable influence of [Johnny Ive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ive), Apple wouldn't look half as impressive as it does.  I hope he got a lot of stock.\n\nSo ever since the beginning of the iPod, Apple has been working on hardware and software UIs designed specifically for on-the-go devices.  That famous iPod clicky wheel can be used easily one handed while sitting on the subway looking out the window.  Conversely, keyboards and mice are not exactly on-the-go devices, except maybe on a laptop.  Even there Apple came up with a touchpad for their laptops that is at least ten times better than any other touchpad on a laptop.  You can scroll, move fluidly, and click fluidly.  It's great.  But for true, uh, on-the-go-ness, even a laptop doesn't work.  Apple realized that the most direct input is the screen itself.  So they've been developing these gloriously fluid touch screens and the software UIs to back them.  They pioneered this.  They're still the best at it.  All of their competitors - and I'm glad Android is out there - have been playing catch up.\n\nIf this is Apple's bread and butter, who cares about a keyboard and mouse?  For their latest iteration of the mouse, they just threw a bit of touch sensitivity on top for scrolling and called it a day.\n\nThis presents a scary proposition for all the creative people that originated the push towards Mac computers.  All of the writers, coders, designers, and artists out there that appreciated the simplicity and good design of Macs might be in for a surprise.  For the longest time, these people could be characterized as either [mousers or keyboardists](http://whydoeseverythingsuck.com/2008/08/mousers-vs-keyboardists.html).  Apple thinks they've found a bigger market share though, one they can in part help create: tapists.\n\nKeyboards and mice are each remarkably good at one thing.  Keyboards provide exceptional tactile feedback for using lots of different pieces of input very, very fast.  On a keyboard, you have at your disposal well over a hundred different keystrokes.  Good keyboardists can use these to type 80 words a minute; some far, far faster.  Watch a good keyboardist program, where they use ! @ $ & * ( ) = ; : < > / . ? with abandon and marvel at their speed.  Watch someone good in Emacs and you might shed a tear at the sight.\n\nOn the other hand, a good mouser can be just as efficient at different tasks.  A mouse provides a single very precise point (the cursor) of easily trackable movement.  Most good mousers are trained from games.  They can navigate around a screen to perform tasks with remarkable speed, their brain typically 3 or 4 steps ahead of the click they're making at any moment.  It can be an impressive sight.\n\nToday, Apple and others are creating a new type of user.  The tapist.  A tapist simply touches the screen and it magically does what they want.  Tapping has neither the tactile ability to provide multiple fast inputs nor precise single inputs.  A tap is a big fat finger on the screen, one at a time.  Almost nothing can be created this way.  The form of input prevents a tapist from creating anything longer than a sentence or two, or from doing any complex task.  It's designed for Twitter, text, and facebook: consumption in one sentence snippets.\n\nApple and Google both think this is a remarkably large market share.  Most of the population even.  That's sort of sad isn't it?  If the standard computer of the future is an iPad, how will someone learn to use a computer for complex tasks?  Nevermind [tinkering](http://al3x.net/2010/01/28/ipad.html), which is what most people have been worried about.  What about programming, writing, designing artful images in Photoshop, archiving photos and manipulating them (besides pinch and zoom), creating music, novels, or any of the other thousand complex creative things one can do with a computer.  Already most kids don't do any of these things.  Instead they sit for hours on Facebook and write on each other's walls.\n\n>I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty \n>to study mathematics and philosophy. My sons ought to study \n>mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history and \n>naval architecture, navigation, commerce and agriculture, \n>in order to give their children a right to study painting, \n>poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry, and porcelain.\n\n>John Adams\n\nMaybe this lack will create a movement back to non-computer mediums.  Maybe writers will use paper and pencil.  Maybe drawing will be done with charcoal.  Maybe photographers will go back to the darkroom.  I doubt it though.\n\nMaybe, over the next decade, these sorts of UIs will get so good that these sorts of complex manipulations are possible once again.  Maybe they'll be faster and easier, and the error correction for input will be so good that the computer will do what we expect it to do even if we didn't get it quite right.  I doubt that too.\n\n<object width=\"640\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/YZoa1jHSpBw&hl=en_US&fs=1&\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/YZoa1jHSpBw&hl=en_US&fs=1&\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\"></embed></object>\n\nInstead, I expect consumption of media will continue to rise in little Twitter-like snippets.  The great exercises of humanity - the ones Adams mentions above - will be even more removed from most of the population.  Thinking will continue to decline.\n\nSo, I'm hedging my bets on the iPad.  I doubt it will replace my laptop, but I'm still going to keep it.  It's dead useful to find that recipe I want to cook while I'm in the kitchen.  Just a couple of taps and it's done.","html":"<p>I bought an iPad.  It's an experiment in trying to be more mobile.  My goal is to find out if it can replace my laptop.

It does not come from Earth First. It does not come from the\n> Sierra Club. It was not drawn by Socialists or Nazis or Osama Bin Laden or anyone from\n> Goldman-Sachs. If you are a Republican Tea-Partier, rest assured it does not come from a\n> progressive Democrat. And vice versa. It was drawn by the United States Department of Energy,\n> and the United States military's Joint Forces Command concurs with the overall picture.\n\nThe most fascinating thing about all of the energy conversations that exist is that they are all focused on the ten to thirty year time frame.  What's going to happen in 2020, 2030, etc.  The concept of peak oil is generally considered within this context.  That annotates them for me as  political arguments.  This is not to say that they're directly tied to election results or specific political power.  Rather, they're focused on divvying up the resources that exist now in such a way as to ensure that the ones doing the divvying get the most.\n\n[Peak oil is not a myth](http://www.prisonplanet.com/archives/peak_oil/index.htm).  By definition, fossil fuels are finite resources.  When considering the course of human history, we cannot consider them infinite.  We've rapidly increased our technology on the mule back of oil, and going forward we have to consider the implication of that dependency.\n\nWay back in 1956, this was the principal topic of Hubbert's initial paper, \"[Nuclear Energy and Fossil Fuels](http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf)\", considering the extent of fossil fuels.  Hubbert was using the finitude of fossil fuels as a bandstand to advocate the nuclear revolution.  He was partially successful, until nuclear power got a bit ahead of itself and a few disasters piqued the public's interest enough for politicians to back away from funding.\n\nBut Hubbert's original contention, which we've largely displaced with political conversations, was that we as a species must consider alternative sources to drive support for our culture forward.  Energy is the single most important consideration to our way of life.  Everything else, our transportation, food production, manufacturing, clothing, leisure - everything is driven off energy.  Specifically, it's driven off a known finite resource.  We don't know the upper bound exactly, but we know there's an end somewhere.\n\nWe need to get back to those fundamental points.  Consider this graph from Hubbert's original paper:\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhyrr/mhyrr.github.com/master/images/hubbert-peak.jpg)\nThere's a lot of similarity to the DOE's more recent graph.  The peak is a touch off, maybe a decade or two.  The language is similar too: \"future discoveries\" and \"unidentified projects\".  We should consider Hubbert's predictive power accurate.  He very accurately predicted the same curves for the oil and gas production of Texas and the United States.  On a global scale, we should expect the error to be slightly larger, so a decade or two makes sense.\n\nFor the long view on energy, an excellent place to start is the marvelously useless [Drake Equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation).  The Drake Equation is an estimation for the number of civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy.  The factors stated are:\n\n  * R* = the average rate of star formation per year in our galaxy\n  * f<sub>p</sub> = the fraction of those stars that have planets\n  * n<sub>e</sub> = the average number of planets that can potentially support life per star that has planets\n  * f<sub>ℓ</sub> = the fraction of the above that actually go on to develop life at some point\n  * f<sub>i</sub> = the fraction of the above that actually go on to develop intelligent life\n  * f<sub>c</sub> = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space\n  * L = the length of time such civilizations release detectable signals into space.\n\nWe care about f<sub>c</sub> and L.\n\nFor civilizations to continue beyond a certain point, a combination of planetary resources is necessary.  Oil has convenient ties to early life, so sufficient evolution (on the order of a couple billion years) of carbon-based organisms will produce hydrocarbons suitable for energy.  But additional material is important.  For Earth, it's been a combination of metals, silicon, and carbon.  Elsewhere, perhaps it could be other elements.\n\nWhat the materials are is largely irrelevant, but the materials must exist for intelligent life to develop technology.  The larger question is the L factor: the length of time these civilizations, including ours, have the available technology.\n\nCurrently, we humans are earth-bound.  We've had a couple hundred years with fossil fuels, and we've done a solid job of advancing the way of life of humanity.  The third world is slowly disappearing, infant mortality is still dropping, life expectancy is increasing, and the quality of life is increasing.  We can travel with relative ease around most of the planet and we can launch rockets, people, and scientific experiments out of the atmosphere and into space.  All essentially based on fossil fuels for energy.\n\nConsider Hubbert's peak graph again.  Let's move the peak forward a couple of decades and consider the tail longer.  Let's say we have the equivalent oil resources and production in 2100 as we did in 1940.  What will happen?  Where will we get our energy for the at least ten billion people that will be alive then?  Look out another hundred years to where most of the oil available is depleted.  This isn't that far forward, there's less time between now and 2200 than there is between now and the War of 1812.  Will humans be earth-bound?  Will the earth still support all of us on our current energy?  What will our future be then?\n\nAt some point, humanity will either remain earthbound with whatever resources are available exclusively from our planet, or will reach a planetary exit trajectory - a method of energy will be developed, piggybacked off our available Earthly resources, that will provide far more than we currently have.  \n\nThere seem to be three possible outcomes:\n\n- We will have enough fossil fuels and time to provide ourselves a planetary exit trajectory, enabling humans to extend beyond the length of the Earth.  \n\n- We will manage to have enough energy to provide ourselves a comfortable planetary history.  We will move past the finite resources to be able to consume *and store* solar and other energies in an appropriate fashion.  This energy will be sufficient to sustain a progressive technological future on Earth.\n\n- We will not have enough energy to provide a comfortable planetary history.  As the finite resources we currently use peter out, we will reform into a more agrarian based society, without the continued technological progress that has gotten us to where we are.\n\nThe differences between the 3 scenarios above is completely unknown.  The available resources to affect the outcome may have a hard limit, or the resources may be available for us to squander at our leisure.\n\nFreeman Dyson talks about cultural evolution replacing biological evolution on this planet over the last ten thousand years.  *Homo sapiens* has caused that and is continuing to drive it through our interaction with the biosphere and through our technology.  It's worth considering how that evolution can continue to drive forward beyond the next two hundred years.  If it can, it won't be because of fossil fuels.\n\nUnderstanding the long view helps to inform the perspective on the ecology of our planet.  Hubbert recognized this immediately in his original paper that formed peak oil theory.  This is the last graph in the entire paper:\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhyrr/mhyrr.github.com/master/images/hubbert-history.jpg)\n\t\nIt's worth considering that an Earth-bound humanity may be either inevitable or a positive future.  If cultural evolution is driving us forward with technology, it's also driving us forward in morality and philosophy.  Either way, understanding the ecology of our environment and our energy is fundamentally important to our history as a species and should be considered as such, rather than exclusively in the short term political context of a few decades.\n\t\n\n\n\n","html":"<p>A couple of months ago I ran across <a href=\"http://www.countercurrents.org/arguimbau230410.htm\">this article</a> focused around a particularly interesting graph:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.countercurrents.org/eia1.jpg\" height=\"446\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n\n<p>And the faux harrowing subtext:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Look at this graph and be afraid. It does not come from Earth First. It does not come from the\n  Sierra Club. It was not drawn by Socialists or Nazis or Osama Bin Laden or anyone from\n  Goldman-Sachs. If you are a Republican Tea-Partier, rest assured it does not come from a\n  progressive Democrat. And vice versa. It was drawn by the United States Department of Energy,\n  and the United States military's Joint Forces Command concurs with the overall picture.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The most fascinating thing about all of the energy conversations that exist is that they are all focused on the ten to thirty year time frame.  What's going to happen in 2020, 2030, etc.  The concept of peak oil is generally considered within this context.  That annotates them for me as  political arguments.  This is not to say that they're directly tied to election results or specific political power.  Rather, they're focused on divvying up the resources that exist now in such a way as to ensure that the ones doing the divvying get the most.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.prisonplanet.com/archives/peak_oil/index.htm\">Peak oil is not a myth</a>.  By definition, fossil fuels are finite resources.  When considering the course of human history, we cannot consider them infinite.  We've rapidly increased our technology on the mule back of oil, and going forward we have to consider the implication of that dependency.</p>\n\n<p>Way back in 1956, this was the principal topic of Hubbert's initial paper, \"<a href=\"http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf\">Nuclear Energy and Fossil Fuels</a>\", considering the extent of fossil fuels.  Hubbert was using the finitude of fossil fuels as a bandstand to advocate the nuclear revolution.  He was partially successful, until nuclear power got a bit ahead of itself and a few disasters piqued the public's interest enough for politicians to back away from funding.</p>\n\n<p>But Hubbert's original contention, which we've largely displaced with political conversations, was that we as a species must consider alternative sources to drive support for our culture forward.  Energy is the single most important consideration to our way of life.  Everything else, our transportation, food production, manufacturing, clothing, leisure - everything is driven off energy.  Specifically, it's driven off a known finite resource.  We don't know the upper bound exactly, but we know there's an end somewhere.</p>\n\n<p>We need to get back to those fundamental points.  Consider this graph from Hubbert's original paper: <br />\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhyrr/mhyrr.github.com/master/images/hubbert-peak.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\nThere's a lot of similarity to the DOE's more recent graph.  The peak is a touch off, maybe a decade or two.  The language is similar too: \"future discoveries\" and \"unidentified projects\".  We should consider Hubbert's predictive power accurate.  He very accurately predicted the same curves for the oil and gas production of Texas and the United States.  On a global scale, we should expect the error to be slightly larger, so a decade or two makes sense.</p>\n\n<p>For the long view on energy, an excellent place to start is the marvelously useless <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation\">Drake Equation</a>.  The Drake Equation is an estimation for the number of civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy.  The factors stated are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>R* = the average rate of star formation per year in our galaxy</li>\n<li>f<sub>p</sub> = the fraction of those stars that have planets</li>\n<li>n<sub>e</sub> = the average number of planets that can potentially support life per star that has planets</li>\n<li>f<sub>ℓ</sub> = the fraction of the above that actually go on to develop life at some point</li>\n<li>f<sub>i</sub> = the fraction of the above that actually go on to develop intelligent life</li>\n<li>f<sub>c</sub> = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space</li>\n<li>L = the length of time such civilizations release detectable signals into space.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We care about f<sub>c</sub> and L.</p>\n\n<p>For civilizations to continue beyond a certain point, a combination of planetary resources is necessary.  Oil has convenient ties to early life, so sufficient evolution (on the order of a couple billion years) of carbon-based organisms will produce hydrocarbons suitable for energy.  But additional material is important.  For Earth, it's been a combination of metals, silicon, and carbon.  Elsewhere, perhaps it could be other elements.</p>\n\n<p>What the materials are is largely irrelevant, but the materials must exist for intelligent life to develop technology.  The larger question is the L factor: the length of time these civilizations, including ours, have the available technology.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, we humans are earth-bound.  We've had a couple hundred years with fossil fuels, and we've done a solid job of advancing the way of life of humanity.  The third world is slowly disappearing, infant mortality is still dropping, life expectancy is increasing, and the quality of life is increasing.  We can travel with relative ease around most of the planet and we can launch rockets, people, and scientific experiments out of the atmosphere and into space.  All essentially based on fossil fuels for energy.</p>\n\n<p>Consider Hubbert's peak graph again.  Let's move the peak forward a couple of decades and consider the tail longer.  Let's say we have the equivalent oil resources and production in 2100 as we did in 1940.  What will happen?  Where will we get our energy for the at least ten billion people that will be alive then?  Look out another hundred years to where most of the oil available is depleted.  This isn't that far forward, there's less time between now and 2200 than there is between now and the War of 1812.  Will humans be earth-bound?  Will the earth still support all of us on our current energy?  What will our future be then?</p>\n\n<p>At some point, humanity will either remain earthbound with whatever resources are available exclusively from our planet, or will reach a planetary exit trajectory - a method of energy will be developed, piggybacked off our available Earthly resources, that will provide far more than we currently have.  </p>\n\n<p>There seem to be three possible outcomes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>We will have enough fossil fuels and time to provide ourselves a planetary exit trajectory, enabling humans to extend beyond the length of the Earth.  </p></li>\n<li><p>We will manage to have enough energy to provide ourselves a comfortable planetary history.  We will move past the finite resources to be able to consume <em>and store</em> solar and other energies in an appropriate fashion.  This energy will be sufficient to sustain a progressive technological future on Earth.</p></li>\n<li><p>We will not have enough energy to provide a comfortable planetary history.  As the finite resources we currently use peter out, we will reform into a more agrarian based society, without the continued technological progress that has gotten us to where we are.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The differences between the 3 scenarios above is completely unknown.  The available resources to affect the outcome may have a hard limit, or the resources may be available for us to squander at our leisure.</p>\n\n<p>Freeman Dyson talks about cultural evolution replacing biological evolution on this planet over the last ten thousand years.  <em>Homo sapiens</em> has caused that and is continuing to drive it through our interaction with the biosphere and through our technology.  It's worth considering how that evolution can continue to drive forward beyond the next two hundred years.  If it can, it won't be because of fossil fuels.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding the long view helps to inform the perspective on the ecology of our planet.  Hubbert recognized this immediately in his original paper that formed peak oil theory.  This is the last graph in the entire paper: <br />\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhyrr/mhyrr.github.com/master/images/hubbert-history.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>It's worth considering that an Earth-bound humanity may be either inevitable or a positive future.  If cultural evolution is driving us forward with technology, it's also driving us forward in morality and philosophy.  Either way, understanding the ecology of our environment and our energy is fundamentally important to our history as a species and should be considered as such, rather than exclusively in the short term political context of a few decades.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"de_DE","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2010-08-04T03:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2017-04-04T01:43:20.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2010-08-04T03:00:00.000Z","published_by":1,"visibility":"public","mobiledoc":null,"amp":null},{"id":44,"uuid":"5e0bf554-3e76-4c39-8919-9e78da64a4a9","title":"My Evented Life - Why Asynchronous I/O Does Not Work Everyday","slug":"eventedlife","markdown":"Recently, I (re)read two articles that made clear to me the misappropriation of time in most people's lives.

But people are dumb.  There's never been an occasion in history that a large group of people has produced intelligent thinking by anything other than chance.  Any other examples always had a small group of leaders moving the entire group towards an end.\n\n\t\tEvery complex problem has a solution that is simple, neat, and wrong.\n\t\t-- H.L Mencken\n\nGroups don't think deeply.  That's the root cause.  They take the path of least resistance and push with sheer mass.  Think about a complex problem like taxes.  What will the population say?  \"Lower taxes for the poor and middle class!\"  And maybe, \"Tax the rich!\"  It's a simple solution.  Neat.  But very shallow and very wrong.\n\nAs individuals, there are lots of endeavors that can be especially promising for contrary thinking.  Two of the biggest I can think of are investing and any sort of intellectual venture.  I've heard lots of little quips about how to do this.  Warren Buffet said \"Be greedy when people are fearful, and fearful when people are greedy.\"  Baron Rothschild said \"When there's blood on the streets, buy property.\"  But the best I've ever heard is from Doyle Brunson.  Here's an excerpt from Super System on No Limit Holdem:\n\n\t\tOn Ace-King\n\n\t\t\tAn A-K is a \"better\" hand than two Aces or two Kings for two very important reasons:\n\t\t\t(1) You'll *win more* money when you make a hand with it; and\n\t\t\t(2) You'll *lose less* money when you miss a hand with it.\n\t\t\tAnd I can't think of two better reasons than those to prefer an A-K over the very big Pairs.\n\t\n\t\tOn Small connectors (4-5, 5-6, 6-7, etc)\n\n\t\t\tSmall connecting cards are a hand that's not designed to put a whole lot of money in with \n\t\t\tbefore the Flop.  It is a hand that's designed to take a lot of Flops with.  You want to \n\t\t\tget a Turn with them to try to make a little Straight, a little Set of Threes, a little \n\t\t\tTwo-Pair.. or something.\n\t\t\t...\n\t\t\tThe beautiful part about having the small connecting cards is that if you don't get any \n\t\t\thelp.. you throw them away.  If the turn comes 9-9-2, for example, you don't get \n\t\t\tinvolved with a 7-6.  You're through.\n\nIt's important to note that poker is a zero-sum game, but the same general philosophy can be applied elsewhere.\n\nThis is damned good advice.  But why?  And why is it so hard to follow?\n\n### Veiled Truth\n\nIt's so hard to follow because it's so easy to recognize big hands.  When you get dealt two Aces in the hole, you get a little giddy and you want to kill with them.  But logic dictates that it's really a bad hand.  And it's bad *because* you want to kill with them.  They're hard to fold. \n\nIt takes a bit of thinking to get around this problem, something a group will never achieve.  The logic is self evident but hard to understand.  Poker, on the surface, is about having the best hand.  Think a bit more deeply and that's not quite right.  You can win without the best hand, so it must be something else.  Poker is actually about making money.  It's about having the most chips in front of you.  You have to recognize it on your own to really get it and apply it.  Big pairs are not the best hands in No Limit Holdem.  You win small pots with them and lose big pots with them.\n\n\t\tObscuris vera involvens\n\t\t-- Virgil\n\nThe same thing happens in investing.  If you took Warren's advice in the real estate market, you would've been sitting on cash in 2007 while everyone else was buying at exorbitant prices, and you'd be buying short sales and foreclosures right now and turning good profits on them with less risk because your investments were smaller.\n\n### Fail Fast, Fail Early\n\nIn the startup scene you hear \"Fail Fast, Fail Early\" a lot.  It's the same thing here.  When you miss your flop with a 4-5, it's really easy to get away from.  You've got nothing.  You'll lose less money with that hand.\n\nBlogging is like this.  Nobody expects much out of blogging.  You're allowed to write a bunch of crap on a blog.  You're almost expected to.  That's a very good thing since, in order to write eloquently, you have to trudge through a bunch of crap first.  Fundamentally, it's called learning.  By the way, [another blog post](http://www.sebastianmarshall.com/?p=195) got me to write this one (thanks Sebastian!). \n\n\t\tSuccess is going from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.\n\t\t-- Churchill\n\nEveryone worries way too much about failure, including me.  Failure is a tremendous learning opportunity.  The key is to set it up so that when you do fail, you're ready to jump into the next thing.\n\n### Play\n\nEver notice when you embark on a big project you feel weighed down?  It halts your progress because you have some understanding of the scope of the project.  There are a huge number of things I've either stopped or not started because of that sheer weight on my shoulders.\n\nThe things I actually do, I do for fun.  And they almost always start small.\n\n\t\tHumanity has advanced, when it has advanced, not because it has been sober, \n\t\tresponsible, and cautious, but because it has been playful, rebellious, and immature.\n\t\t-- Tom Robbins\n\n### Sic Transit Gloria Mundi\n\nSo think about what Doyle says.  Ponder, fail, and play.  In the end, it won't matter much anyway.  \n\nSebastian quoted Ozymandias, but I very much prefer Auden:\n\n\t\tAbout suffering they were never wrong,\n\t\tThe Old Masters; how well, they understood\n\t\tIts human position; how it takes place\n\t\tWhile someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along;\n\t\tHow, when the aged are reverently, passionately waiting\n\t\tFor the miraculous birth, there always must be\n\t\tChildren who did not specially want it to happen, skating\n\t\tOn a pond at the edge of the wood:\n\t\tThey never forgot\n\t\tThat even the dreadful martyrdom must run its course\n\t\tAnyhow in a corner, some untidy spot\n\t\tWhere the dogs go on with their doggy life and the torturer's horse\n\t\tScratches its innocent behind on a tree.\n\n\t\tIn Breughel's Icarus, for instance: how everything turns away\n\t\tQuite leisurely from the disaster; the ploughman may \n\t\tHave heard the splash, the forsaken cry,\n\t\tBut for him it was not an important failure; the sun shone\n\t\tAs it had to on the white legs disappearing into the green\n\t\tWater; and the expensive delicate ship that must have seen\n\t\tSomething amazing, a boy falling out of the sky,\n\t\thad somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on.","html":"<p>There is something fundamentally human about being contrary.

Two of the biggest I can think of are investing and any sort of intellectual venture.  I've heard lots of little quips about how to do this.  Warren Buffet said \"Be greedy when people are fearful, and fearful when people are greedy.\"  Baron Rothschild said \"When there's blood on the streets, buy property.\"  But the best I've ever heard is from Doyle Brunson.  Here's an excerpt from Super System on No Limit Holdem:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    On Ace-King\n\n        An A-K is a \"better\" hand than two Aces or two Kings for two very important reasons:\n        (1) You'll *win more* money when you make a hand with it; and\n        (2) You'll *lose less* money when you miss a hand with it.\n        And I can't think of two better reasons than those to prefer an A-K over the very big Pairs.\n\n    On Small connectors (4-5, 5-6, 6-7, etc)\n\n        Small connecting cards are a hand that's not designed to put a whole lot of money in with \n        before the Flop.  It is a hand that's designed to take a lot of Flops with.  You want to \n        get a Turn with them to try to make a little Straight, a little Set of Threes, a little \n        Two-Pair.. or something.\n        ...\n        The beautiful part about having the small connecting cards is that if you don't get any \n        help.. you throw them away.  If the turn comes 9-9-2, for example, you don't get \n        involved with a 7-6.

It was the best day of my life.\n\nBefore the wedding I got into a habit of occasionally watching Bridezillas.  Yes, I admit it.  I'd heard of it before and my curiosity got the best of me while flipping channels.  That show is brilliant marketing-- once it's on, you can't turn away from it.  It's like watching a car crash, you want badly to not see it, but you just can't turn away.  \n\nBridezillas is one of a new type of TV program that shows the worst of American culture, and it does it very matter-of-factly, especially considering that they're chronicling what should be one of the happiest days in the lives of the folks on it.\n\n### Weddings are Short\n\nSince my wedding day, life has been a delightful whirlwind of activity.  It's given me a lot to think about, especially about marriage.  But to say exactly what I want to, I need to relay some of the events of the past month.\n\nThe day of the marriage itself is mostly a blur, but I have some shimmering images frozen in place in my mind.  I remember very clearly the first glimpse of my bride as she came out of the little room at the back of the church and I remember her walking down the aisle.  I remember our quiet moment behind the altar during the Ave Maria and I remember our first dance.  I think we were both hovering and spinning two feet off the floor.\n\nIt turned out perfectly, but we didn't plan it that way.  The best piece of advice we got was from our photographer.  He told us that weddings are this crazy thing that end up having a life of their own.  He said it wouldn't be exactly what we thought it would be, but that it would be better.  That stuck with us both I think, and helped us to let things be as they were going to be.  The wedding would be over in only a matter of hours.  So we focused on the important parts - that we were going to be married for the rest of our lives, and that our family and friends were there to celebrate with us.  \n\n### Honeymoons and Hurricanes\n\nWe chose St. Lucia for our honeymoon, a charming little ex-British isle with winding mountain roads, huge palm trees, dazzling blue water, and a very hospitable culture.  \n\nWe left for Dulles airport at 3AM on Monday to catch our 6AM flight to Miami.  By the time we got to St. Lucia we were pretty exhausted, but not too exhausted to people watch.  The customs line at the airport was a perfect place for people watching.  The entire line, probably 200 people, was pairs of newlyweds celebrating their marriage.\n\nAt least, we think they were \"celebrating\" their marriage.  We were still giddy from the experience of getting married two days ago despite two flights (I'm not fond of flying) and not much sleep.  A lot of the couples looked either bored or annoyed.  They had twice as many bags as they needed, mostly pulled by the men.  The women meanwhile all had fake manicures and shirts with \"Bride\" written in rhinestones.  We even saw a few \"Groom\" shirts.  No joke.  I don't think they used rhinestones though.\n\nIt felt.. well, fake.  Commercialized.  They didn't look happy to be married, they looked bored now that the wedding was over.  We started playing a sort of sad game: trying to pick out the couples that would get divorced and how long it would be.  We figured the more downtrodden the guy, the brighter the pink \"Juicy\" pants of the girl, or the more obvious the rhinestone \"BRIDE\" flashing at everyone, the more likely the divorce.\n\nOnce we got past the customs line, the next few days were fantastic.  We explored St. Lucia, read books on the beach, took a day trip to Martinique, went ziplining, and relaxed together.  Saturday the weather took a turn for the worse when Tropical Storm Tomas paid us a visit.  The forecast suggested it would be gone by Saturday afternoon.  It wasn't.  Instead the storm sat off our west coast and intensified into a hurricane.  \n\nHurricane Tomas finally fled early Sunday morning, but it had left its mark.  The island was without power or water, bridges were washed out, and both airports were closed.  We were on the north end of the island and fared much better than the south.  Still, there was noticeable damage, and we both felt uncomfortable sitting in our resort when we could be helping.  Unfortunately, we weren't allowed to do much and the staff continued to serve the guests very efficiently.  Within a day, you'd think nothing had happened in our little corner of the island.  But the airports were still closed and some people were starting to complain.\n\nFunny thing was, the only people really complaining were the American honeymooners.  The Brits and Canadians didn't complain at all, they just relaxed and enjoyed themselves.  Even the staff, mostly without power at their homes, kept pouring drinks with a smile.\n\nWe were fortunate in that we didn't have to leave until Wednesday, but we still didn't get off the island until Thursday, and it was a bit tricky.  The main airport wasn't accessible and no planes were coming in.  We got ahold of American Airlines (after a bit of work) and they rerouted us from the small airport through Puerto Rico and finally back to BWI.  The caveat was that each flight had only one seat.  So my wife flew off the island at 10:30 and I flew off at 12:30 and we rendezvoused in San Juan.\n\nWhen I say this airport was small, I mean tiny.  It was one runway and the 50 passenger prop plane we flew out on was the biggest plane there.  The ticket desks had lines out into the parking lot as they were still trying to catch up everyone that hadn't left from the storm.  Our boarding passes were slips of paper with the flight number written in pen.\n\nOnce again, the Americans were obvious.  The girls (forgive me) were prissy, acting out, crying, and the guys just didn't know what to do with it.  Not once did they either comfort or call their wives out on their behavior. Instead they just acted out in their own way.  The Brits, French, and Canadians meanwhile were calm and reading their books.\n\nWe, I'm somewhat proud to say, considered it an adventure.  I won't say it wasn't stressful, because it was, especially the bit about flying separately.  Leaving your new wife is not something you want to do on a honeymoon.  But we did it, and it worked out just fine.  \n\nThe most frustrating part of leaving my wife was when we found out on the flight that the only reason we each only had one seat was because a bunch of people double and triple booked seats on every flight in their panic to get home.  We heard stories of 3, 4 and 5 hop flights to get through the islands, huge cell phone bills, rental cars and 5 hour car trips from airports-- all to get back to the states.  The Americans just didn't know what to do in such a different situation.\n\nAfter the whole mess, we finally took a taxi home from BWI and got to our doorstep at 2:30AM, tired but still excited to be home and starting our lives together.\n\n### Decisions\n\nI went through all of that to say a few things, with a whopping month of experience behind me, about what marriage is and is not.\n\nFirst, **getting married is a humbling experience.**  If it's not, you're doing it wrong.  Brides and grooms: contrary to the huge blast of marketing we all get from the corporate machine surrounding weddings today, it is NOT your day.  Weddings have a mind of their own and, like everyone else, you're along for the ride.  Weddings are a celebration of your love with those closest to you.  It's best experienced if you have the chance to stay humble each step of the way.  For us, each gift we opened and every face we saw that day was a reminder of our great good fortune.  Because it was humbling, it was hard to be anything but thankful and happy.  \n\nThis was why we kept laughing at all the women with BRIDE shirts on our honeymoon.  It was a sign that they thought the whole experience was theirs.  They owned it, it was their day, and everyone should know it.  Not unlike what we see on Bridezillas, just more socially acceptable.  Kinda.\n\nThe commercial wedding machine has another effect.  Most people look forward to the wedding more than the marriage.  It's all about the big day.  But it's important to remember that **the purpose of the wedding is marriage**.  The day is just a day, and it will end quickly.\n\nAll those BRIDE shirts and fake manicures had bored faces above them, because the wedding day was over.  They were trying to cling to that day rather than embrace the fact that they were married.  In their minds, I really think they went from \"beautiful bride\" to \"old married maid\" in one day.  That's what our culture has shown them.\n\nEvery day after the wedding day is more important than the wedding day itself.  A marriage is a lifetime and it is wonderful.  We should all be lucky enough to prepare for it through a wedding.\n\nI don't mean by this that people shouldn't do it up on their wedding day.  They should.  We certainly did.  One of the things I was so pleased about was how authentic our wedding felt.  Perhaps I'm biased, but there were no pretensions-- it felt like \"us\".. like Maureen and Greg.  Weddings are about celebrating, not about appearing beautiful, rich or better than anyone else.\n\nThat last point is important, and one we saw echoed on the honeymoon.  The top two reasons for divorce in our country are infidelity and financial problems.  So **live within your means, and start that on your wedding day.**\n\nIt seems common today for weddings to go as big as possible, with the bride and groom getting enormous party limos, insane catering, destination weddings, even multiple dresses for the bride.  When the hurricane hit on our honeymoon, a bunch of couples were making expensive phone calls home to their parents to get their credit extended, or to get cash advances.  It seemed like none of them could really afford their honeymoon.\n\nAgain, none of these things is wrong by itself.  Rather they are warning signs.  Why is $2,000 in flowers needed, especially if it's not in the budget?  Same question for the honeymoon.  If you're fortunate enough to have a wedding with all the trappings, be humble.  But if you can't see yourself deliriously happy getting married cheaply in a very simple ceremony and driving in a thirty year old Pinto to the local beach for a one night honeymoon, I wonder what it is you're celebrating.  Is it a wedding or a \"look at me!\" photoshoot?\n\nAll of this leads me to one last point.  When I was trying to understand the decision in front of me to marry Maureen and whether it was the right choice or not, I of course talked it over with some of my closest friends.  My friend Dominic had a particularly memorable answer.  Dom is older and established, he has a lovely wife and three children.  So I asked him when he *knew* that his wife was the one for him.  He said, \"You know Greg, I remember one fine Sunday morning a few years ago.  The whole family had just gotten back from church and my wife was in the kitchen making breakfast for the kids and I was putting some plates out.  I saw her smiling as she worked and I thought 'Wow.  I really picked the right one.'\"\n\nI was flabbergasted at first.  How could you not know she was the one for you until years after your wedding?  Then I realized his main point: **love is a DECISION.**  \n\nThat's the rub.  There was a certain unadaptability in many of the couples we saw and were scared for.  They didn't want to change.  They weren't willing to say- yes! I share my life with this person, we're completely together.  It takes a lot of effort to see something from the other person's perspective, to be willing to recognize that your life is so wound up in this other person's that you are inseparable.  But that's what marriage actually is: choosing to love and live together, as one.\n\nLike the perfect wedding that so many people seem to want, the perfect person, the perfect spouse, the soulmate, all of these ideas aren't real.  It won't turn out like you expect-- and if you expect the perfect spouse, the other person can never live up to your expectations.  But the truth is better than that.\n\nLove is a decision, and that's how you live happily-ever-after.\n\n ","html":"<p>About a month ago, I got married.

I remember our quiet moment behind the altar during the Ave Maria and I remember our first dance.  I think we were both hovering and spinning two feet off the floor.</p>\n\n<p>It turned out perfectly, but we didn't plan it that way.  The best piece of advice we got was from our photographer.  He told us that weddings are this crazy thing that end up having a life of their own.  He said it wouldn't be exactly what we thought it would be, but that it would be better.  That stuck with us both I think, and helped us to let things be as they were going to be.  The wedding would be over in only a matter of hours.  So we focused on the important parts - that we were going to be married for the rest of our lives, and that our family and friends were there to celebrate with us.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"honeymoonsandhurricanes\">Honeymoons and Hurricanes</h3>\n\n<p>We chose St. Lucia for our honeymoon, a charming little ex-British isle with winding mountain roads, huge palm trees, dazzling blue water, and a very hospitable culture.  </p>\n\n<p>We left for Dulles airport at 3AM on Monday to catch our 6AM flight to Miami.  By the time we got to St. Lucia we were pretty exhausted, but not too exhausted to people watch.  The customs line at the airport was a perfect place for people watching.  The entire line, probably 200 people, was pairs of newlyweds celebrating their marriage.</p>\n\n<p>At least, we think they were \"celebrating\" their marriage.  We were still giddy from the experience of getting married two days ago despite two flights (I'm not fond of flying) and not much sleep.  A lot of the couples looked either bored or annoyed.  They had twice as many bags as they needed, mostly pulled by the men.  The women meanwhile all had fake manicures and shirts with \"Bride\" written in rhinestones.  We even saw a few \"Groom\" shirts.  No joke.  I don't think they used rhinestones though.</p>\n\n<p>It felt.. well, fake.  Commercialized.  They didn't look happy to be married, they looked bored now that the wedding was over.  We started playing a sort of sad game: trying to pick out the couples that would get divorced and how long it would be.  We figured the more downtrodden the guy, the brighter the pink \"Juicy\" pants of the girl, or the more obvious the rhinestone \"BRIDE\" flashing at everyone, the more likely the divorce.</p>\n\n<p>Once we got past the customs line, the next few days were fantastic.  We explored St. Lucia, read books on the beach, took a day trip to Martinique, went ziplining, and relaxed together.  Saturday the weather took a turn for the worse when Tropical Storm Tomas paid us a visit.  The forecast suggested it would be gone by Saturday afternoon.  It wasn't.  Instead the storm sat off our west coast and intensified into a hurricane.  </p>\n\n<p>Hurricane Tomas finally fled early Sunday morning, but it had left its mark.  The island was without power or water, bridges were washed out, and both airports were closed.  We were on the north end of the island and fared much better than the south.  Still, there was noticeable damage, and we both felt uncomfortable sitting in our resort when we could be helping.  Unfortunately, we weren't allowed to do much and the staff continued to serve the guests very efficiently.  Within a day, you'd think nothing had happened in our little corner of the island.  But the airports were still closed and some people were starting to complain.</p>\n\n<p>Funny thing was, the only people really complaining were the American honeymooners.  The Brits and Canadians didn't complain at all, they just relaxed and enjoyed themselves.  Even the staff, mostly without power at their homes, kept pouring drinks with a smile.</p>\n\n<p>We were fortunate in that we didn't have to leave until Wednesday, but we still didn't get off the island until Thursday, and it was a bit tricky.  The main airport wasn't accessible and no planes were coming in.  We got ahold of American Airlines (after a bit of work) and they rerouted us from the small airport through Puerto Rico and finally back to BWI.  The caveat was that each flight had only one seat.  So my wife flew off the island at 10:30 and I flew off at 12:30 and we rendezvoused in San Juan.</p>\n\n<p>When I say this airport was small, I mean tiny.  It was one runway and the 50 passenger prop plane we flew out on was the biggest plane there.  The ticket desks had lines out into the parking lot as they were still trying to catch up everyone that hadn't left from the storm.  Our boarding passes were slips of paper with the flight number written in pen.</p>\n\n<p>Once again, the Americans were obvious.  The girls (forgive me) were prissy, acting out, crying, and the guys just didn't know what to do with it.  Not once did they either comfort or call their wives out on their behavior. Instead they just acted out in their own way.  The Brits, French, and Canadians meanwhile were calm and reading their books.</p>\n\n<p>We, I'm somewhat proud to say, considered it an adventure.  I won't say it wasn't stressful, because it was, especially the bit about flying separately.  Leaving your new wife is not something you want to do on a honeymoon.  But we did it, and it worked out just fine.  </p>\n\n<p>The most frustrating part of leaving my wife was when we found out on the flight that the only reason we each only had one seat was because a bunch of people double and triple booked seats on every flight in their panic to get home.  We heard stories of 3, 4 and 5 hop flights to get through the islands, huge cell phone bills, rental cars and 5 hour car trips from airports-- all to get back to the states.  The Americans just didn't know what to do in such a different situation.</p>\n\n<p>After the whole mess, we finally took a taxi home from BWI and got to our doorstep at 2:30AM, tired but still excited to be home and starting our lives together.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"decisions\">Decisions</h3>\n\n<p>I went through all of that to say a few things, with a whopping month of experience behind me, about what marriage is and is not.</p>\n\n<p>First, <strong>getting married is a humbling experience.</strong>  If it's not, you're doing it wrong.  Brides and grooms: contrary to the huge blast of marketing we all get from the corporate machine surrounding weddings today, it is NOT your day.  Weddings have a mind of their own and, like everyone else, you're along for the ride.  Weddings are a celebration of your love with those closest to you.  It's best experienced if you have the chance to stay humble each step of the way.  For us, each gift we opened and every face we saw that day was a reminder of our great good fortune.  Because it was humbling, it was hard to be anything but thankful and happy.  </p>\n\n<p>This was why we kept laughing at all the women with BRIDE shirts on our honeymoon.  It was a sign that they thought the whole experience was theirs.  They owned it, it was their day, and everyone should know it.  Not unlike what we see on Bridezillas, just more socially acceptable.  Kinda.</p>\n\n<p>The commercial wedding machine has another effect.  Most people look forward to the wedding more than the marriage.  It's all about the big day.  But it's important to remember that <strong>the purpose of the wedding is marriage</strong>.  The day is just a day, and it will end quickly.</p>\n\n<p>All those BRIDE shirts and fake manicures had bored faces above them, because the wedding day was over.  They were trying to cling to that day rather than embrace the fact that they were married.  In their minds, I really think they went from \"beautiful bride\" to \"old married maid\" in one day.  That's what our culture has shown them.</p>\n\n<p>Every day after the wedding day is more important than the wedding day itself.  A marriage is a lifetime and it is wonderful.  We should all be lucky enough to prepare for it through a wedding.</p>\n\n<p>I don't mean by this that people shouldn't do it up on their wedding day.  They should.  We certainly did.  One of the things I was so pleased about was how authentic our wedding felt.  Perhaps I'm biased, but there were no pretensions-- it felt like \"us\".. like Maureen and Greg.  Weddings are about celebrating, not about appearing beautiful, rich or better than anyone else.</p>\n\n<p>That last point is important, and one we saw echoed on the honeymoon.  The top two reasons for divorce in our country are infidelity and financial problems.  So <strong>live within your means, and start that on your wedding day.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It seems common today for weddings to go as big as possible, with the bride and groom getting enormous party limos, insane catering, destination weddings, even multiple dresses for the bride.  When the hurricane hit on our honeymoon, a bunch of couples were making expensive phone calls home to their parents to get their credit extended, or to get cash advances.  It seemed like none of them could really afford their honeymoon.</p>\n\n<p>Again, none of these things is wrong by itself.  Rather they are warning signs.  Why is $2,000 in flowers needed, especially if it's not in the budget?  Same question for the honeymoon.  If you're fortunate enough to have a wedding with all the trappings, be humble.  But if you can't see yourself deliriously happy getting married cheaply in a very simple ceremony and driving in a thirty year old Pinto to the local beach for a one night honeymoon, I wonder what it is you're celebrating.  Is it a wedding or a \"look at me!\" photoshoot?</p>\n\n<p>All of this leads me to one last point.  When I was trying to understand the decision in front of me to marry Maureen and whether it was the right choice or not, I of course talked it over with some of my closest friends.  My friend Dominic had a particularly memorable answer.  Dom is older and established, he has a lovely wife and three children.  So I asked him when he <em>knew</em> that his wife was the one for him.  He said, \"You know Greg, I remember one fine Sunday morning a few years ago.  The whole family had just gotten back from church and my wife was in the kitchen making breakfast for the kids and I was putting some plates out.  I saw her smiling as she worked and I thought 'Wow.  I really picked the right one.'\"</p>\n\n<p>I was flabbergasted at first.  How could you not know she was the one for you until years after your wedding?  Then I realized his main point: <strong>love is a DECISION.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>That's the rub.  There was a certain unadaptability in many of the couples we saw and were scared for.  They didn't want to change.  They weren't willing to say- yes! I share my life with this person, we're completely together.  It takes a lot of effort to see something from the other person's perspective, to be willing to recognize that your life is so wound up in this other person's that you are inseparable.  But that's what marriage actually is: choosing to love and live together, as one.</p>\n\n<p>Like the perfect wedding that so many people seem to want, the perfect person, the perfect spouse, the soulmate, all of these ideas aren't real.  It won't turn out like you expect-- and if you expect the perfect spouse, the other person can never live up to your expectations.  But the truth is better than that.</p>\n\n<p>Love is a decision, and that's how you live happily-ever-after.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"de_DE","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2010-12-13T05:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2010-12-13T05:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2010-12-13T05:00:00.000Z","published_by":1,"visibility":"public","mobiledoc":null,"amp":null},{"id":49,"uuid":"0cfa0989-9af9-455a-bf43-5cbc6e1c1a9e","title":"Going Forward, Why Apple?","slug":"whyapple","markdown":"The other day I saw a Sprint 4G commercial, and it crystallized why I have and will continue to choose Apple products for the foreseeable future.  I've known that I would continue in this direction, but its been hard to articulate why (which is frustrating when people ask me).\n\nThe commercial emphasized the speed of their new 4G network, saying that it's \"Ten times faster than existing 3G networks\".  There are a bunch of things wrong with this statement.  First, 4G is used here strictly as marketing.  There is a [4G wireless standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4G), and as of this date *none* of the networks out there come anywhere near it.  Second, wireless networks have to cover large land areas and signal strength and capacity vary wildly, so such a blanket statement is impossible to uphold.  These are the obvious problems and I wouldn't even consider anything on Sprint because of them.  But there's something else packed into that one little sentence..\n\nThe bigger issue is that Sprint is focused on relative wealth.  Most technology companies are.  The engineering side of technology has always pushed for more MHz and GHz, more RAM, more MBs and GBs, and more Mbps.  These are, on the whole, positive movements; they enrich the computer and make it a more useful tool for more people.  But somewhere in the transition from engineering to marketing the focus and effort into driving technology forward has somehow morphed into a sociological notion of being better than those around you.\n\nEver hear geeks talk shop?  It's a back and forth of statistics and numbers like 8-core quad Xeon 64 GB with a 10 TB RAID 10 mirrored and striped and dual 8 GB vid cards driving two 90\" monitors.  I am a geek and when I hear this I want to say **who gives a shit?**  Nobody should care.. does it work for you or not?  Can you get done what you want to get done or not?  The ironic thing about these stats is the number of people that have this kind of crap and don't use it.  Most people that talk these numbers are using only a small percentage of their actual computing power.  Meanwhile, the mass of computer-buying consumers are sucked into comparing a 2.2 GHz system with a 2.4 GHz system.  It's the wrong question.\n\nComputers are such a young technology that we've been forced into caring about stuff like this.  A photographer taking 1000+ shots per event isn't going to be able to store and backup his collection on a 16 GB hard drive.  So don't get me wrong, this stuff is important.  Computers need to be able to function effectively as tools for an incredibly diverse set of uses.\n\nWhich brings us to Apple.  Some would describe me as a fanboi.  I've got an iMac, MacBook Pro, iPad and iPhone.  I have these for a reason: they're the best tools for the job, and they all serve different use cases.  The iMac is home base for all my data and is used for business and coding.  The laptop is my portable, with access to everything on the iMac.  It's also where I do most of my writing.  The iPad is the perfect around-the-house internet appliance.  The iPhone is the best device for communicating anywhere I am.  I've got my GMail, Contacts, and Calendar automatically sync'd on all of these.  It's a good system, one where I can access, consume, or produce data as quickly as possible without the computers getting in the way.\n\nAnd I was able to describe that whole thing without a single number or figure.  Utility goes beyond facts and figures.  Back when [I wrote some predictions](http://www.infiniteabyss.org/2010/02/24/some_predictions.html), I came to a somewhat startling conclusion:  \"**The best computer company in the world KNOWS that most people don't care about computers!**\"  This allows Apple to focus on the important question: does it work well enough, or not?  If not, how do we make it better?\n\nThis is a focus on absolute wealth, rather than relative wealth.  Where relative wealth is interested in how you're doing compared to those around you, absolute wealth wants to ensure you have sufficient tools available to do whatever it is that you do.  (Interestingly, this pushes Apple products much more towards the notion of a commodity, which is sort of ironic considering they have higher prices.)\n\nThe iPhone 4's Retina Display is a perfect example of this.  The marketing focus on the display is not it's resolution (although I think they mention it), ppi, LEDs, IPS, or any other stat.  It very well could have been - that little screen is a [really amazing piece of technology](http://www.pcworld.com/article/198201/iphone_4s_retina_display_explained.html).  But instead they pointed out that the display is so clear that the human eye can't differentiate anything better.  It is, in some sense, the best possible screen of that size that a human can use.  Apple products disregard most of their technical specs.  Laptops and iMacs are based first on screen size.  iOS devices publish drive space, but not RAM, processor and the like.\n\nThat puts Sprint's claims into perspective.  Where most technology companies are using a relative scale to beat their competitors, Apple is using a different scale altogether, focused on the fundamental utility of their products.  \n\nAnd that's why I will continue to use Apple.  \n\n\n\n*** As an aside, [The Setup](http://usesthis.com/) is one of my favorite sites.  The breadth and depth of tools described is fascinating, especially when considering their owners.

This odd property, and the growing complexity of my life has forced me to trend towards a certain kind of operating procedure that I've started to call statelessness.\n\nBeing stateless is the opposite of maintaining lots of state.  This could translate to [independent trials](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory) in statistics like separate flips of a coin or [Poisson processes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_process).  In software, dealing with something in a stateless manner greatly simplifies design because there's so much less to worry about.  Each transaction, operation, or whatever can be dealt with independently rather than in consideration of many other transactions.\n\nInterestingly, in life, dealing with things in a stateless manner translates roughly to honesty.  If you aren't maintaining state there's nothing to translate into a coherent set of lies, or a facade of yourself, or anything like that.  It becomes much simpler to operate because, well, there's less state to deal with.  As life gets more and more complex, I think the only two options are to trend towards statelessness or to get completely mired down by trying to deal with too much state.\n\nWhen I talk about life getting more complex, I'm describing a lot more state being introduced into a person's life.  There's two kinds of \"busy\" - the busy you get when you're motivated and have a lot of things you need or want to do, and the kind of busy you get when you have a lot of idle time.  The latter tends to be unproductive.  The former is the productive complexity I'm thinking about.\n\nI think this is how most highly functioning people operate.  A good executive officer (or anyone \"at the helm\", like a ship's captain) will take the information available, evaluate it, and come up with a set of conclusions and drive forward.  They usually won't wallow in their decision or delay.  If they do, they probably won't last long in their post.\n\nThe opposite is also true.  Gossip mongering and over-emphasis of things like fashion or silly culture - basically shows like The Real Housewives - only occurs when life is idle.  When there's not enough state to make people's lives interesting (afterall, humans are complex) they invent state, and usually make things worse for themselves.\n\nIt's a fascinating idea that to be able to deal with more state in your life you have to approach it in a stateless manner.  But what does this mean exactly?  I think it means taking each decision or situation that you're confronted with as independent from others and evaluating it only on the information available.  Sometimes, of course, this will mean digging for more information.  Which means you get to ask the right questions, one of the many benefits of operating like this.  Asking questions keeps you humble.  Approaching every conversation independently keeps you from holding grudges or worrying about past experiences.\n\nI'm still not sure that statelessness is quite the right word for this yet.  I wonder if the notion of having a small cache is more appropriate.  You should keep some small amount of state in the same way that a CPU uses a small, tidy L2 cache instead of slower, larger memory.  These are your defaults.  The small set of axiomatic rules that you start with when evaluating what's around you.  Every situation means you check these rules again, making sure they're still appropriate.  Instead of a Least Recently Used cache, maybe it's a Least Generally Applicable cache.\n\nI've [heard people describe](http://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs) one of the main themes of Stephen King's book *On Writing* as honesty in writing.  But not strict honesty, in that *Carrie*, *The Stand*, or many of his other books are ridiculous fiction.  Rather, they have the feel of truth and are convincing in their story.  Statelessness has the same feel about it to me.  It's not strictly true, factual, or honest.  It doesn't create the best possible outcome in every situation either.  It does get things moving and help you to be truly critical about situations without being over-critical.  When I was worried about performing at work, I asked a very good friend of mine.  He said, \"Just do the best you can, every day.\"  That's stateless.  And it's both humbling and gratifying.\n","html":"<p>I have, at the same time, both a wonderful and an abysmal memory.

A good executive officer (or anyone \"at the helm\", like a ship's captain) will take the information available, evaluate it, and come up with a set of conclusions and drive forward.  They usually won't wallow in their decision or delay.  If they do, they probably won't last long in their post.</p>\n\n<p>The opposite is also true.  Gossip mongering and over-emphasis of things like fashion or silly culture - basically shows like The Real Housewives - only occurs when life is idle.  When there's not enough state to make people's lives interesting (afterall, humans are complex) they invent state, and usually make things worse for themselves.</p>\n\n<p>It's a fascinating idea that to be able to deal with more state in your life you have to approach it in a stateless manner.  But what does this mean exactly?  I think it means taking each decision or situation that you're confronted with as independent from others and evaluating it only on the information available.  Sometimes, of course, this will mean digging for more information.  Which means you get to ask the right questions, one of the many benefits of operating like this.  Asking questions keeps you humble.  Approaching every conversation independently keeps you from holding grudges or worrying about past experiences.</p>\n\n<p>I'm still not sure that statelessness is quite the right word for this yet.  I wonder if the notion of having a small cache is more appropriate.  You should keep some small amount of state in the same way that a CPU uses a small, tidy L2 cache instead of slower, larger memory.  These are your defaults.  The small set of axiomatic rules that you start with when evaluating what's around you.  Every situation means you check these rules again, making sure they're still appropriate.  Instead of a Least Recently Used cache, maybe it's a Least Generally Applicable cache.</p>\n\n<p>I've <a href=\"http://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs\">heard people describe</a> one of the main themes of Stephen King's book <em>On Writing</em> as honesty in writing.  But not strict honesty, in that <em>Carrie</em>, <em>The Stand</em>, or many of his other books are ridiculous fiction.  Rather, they have the feel of truth and are convincing in their story.  Statelessness has the same feel about it to me.  It's not strictly true, factual, or honest.  It doesn't create the best possible outcome in every situation either.  It does get things moving and help you to be truly critical about situations without being over-critical.  When I was worried about performing at work, I asked a very good friend of mine.  He said, \"Just do the best you can, every day.\"  That's stateless.  And it's both humbling and gratifying.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"de_DE","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2010-12-31T05:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2010-12-31T05:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2010-12-31T05:00:00.000Z","published_by":1,"visibility":"public","mobiledoc":null,"amp":null},{"id":51,"uuid":"7da63ac6-1013-4e1a-92d2-d88710a2a7a8","title":"The Optimist's Dilemma","slug":"optimists","markdown":"<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Glass-of-water.jpg/409px-Glass-of-water.jpg\"/>\n\nEverybody's heard the old idiom \"Is the glass half full or half empty?\"  Probably too many times.

They have two enormous problems.  \n\nFirst, they've decided to operate within the two party system, thinking that this is so historically entrenched that they can't possibly get beyond it.  So instead of offering a real alternative to the political game being played, they instead have entered directly into the fray.\n\nTheir second problem is persona.  When I think of the Tea Party, whether right or wrong, I think of Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck.  This makes me incredibly sad.

And I've just finished a book worthy of review.\n\nThat book is The Skeptical Environmentalist by Danish economist Bjorn Lomborg.  You may have heard of Lomborg - he was brashly criticized a number of years ago for speaking against the juggernaut religion of global warming sponsored by the IPCC.\n\nLomborg himself is the skeptic and he does a wonderful job of explaining the State of the World.  Each topic is broken down into quantifiable numbers and analyzed in turn.  He maintains exhaustive notes and references, usually from IPCC or UN sponsored studies, so as to rationally counter the spiced-up language of the Litany.\n\nThe Litany is something we all know: a series of disastrous and pessimistic views on how our world is getting worse.  Deforestation, pollution, cancer, acid rain, mass extinction, ozone depletion, widespread hunger, poverty, rising oceans, ocean acidification, glacial retreat, and of course the all-important carbon concentration in the atmosphere.\n\nLomborg takes all of these and more and decomposes them to understand concretely how they've changed over time.  The surprising thing about this approach is the data itself.  By every measure possible, as he presents the data, the state of humanity and our environment is better now than it has been in the past.  Pollution is decreasing, forest cover has either remained the same or increased, and the developing world is getting richer and less hungry.\n\nAll of this data, which Lomborg so rigorously presents, is a prelude to the main thesis.\n\nThe problem of the environment is not scientific but economic.  In this way, like many surprising solutions, the problem is turned on its side.  The developed world especially has over the past few decades begun to do a far better job in managing the environment than in the past.  The reason we are able to do this is that we are richer.  Asking questions and striving to take care of the environment is something that only the rich can afford to do.  Much of the developing world cannot do this now just like those living in squalor in 15th century London could not.  They worried about neither the exterior nor interior air quality (by the way, interior air quality has historically been far worse than exterior air quality) because they were far busier worrying about their food for tomorrow.  \n\nWe have a largely romantic view of life in the past.  We forget the butcher shops, plague and feces in the streets of 15th century London, or the coal smoke of 19th century London, when we look at the gentrified elegance and cleanliness of 21st century London.\n\nAs the developed world has been able to do a drastically better job at managing the environment, the solution to the problem becomes economic: continue to take the billions of poor and hungry people left in the world and make them richer and less hungry.  As the entire world becomes correspondingly richer, they will be able to better manage the environment.\n\nThis is a radically different solution than carbon sequestering, eliminating fossil fuels, or carbon taxes.  Aside from being remarkably humanitarian, eliminating poverty and hunger is a much more efficient use of our existing money.  Carbon taxes would simply make the poor poorer and the rich who can afford things like solar panels richer.  On the other hand, working on poverty and hunger will not cost much for a huge amount of change to a huge number of people, with the added benefit of helping our environment.\n\nLomborg has been massively criticized as being against the environmental movement.  But as he says, \"nobody is an anti-environmentalist.\"  Instead, he's taken a dramatic look at the resources available to us and chosen to prioritize them so as to make the most out of our human situation.  His conclusions suggest that things are better now than we think and that it's our responsibility to take a hard look at where we spend our money and make the most of it.  Every issue is not equally important and choosing not to prioritize is the same as doing so in a poor, ad-hoc fashion.\n\nThe most interesting critic I read was Alex Kirby, a BBC journalist, who said \"What really riles me about his book is that it is so damnably reasonable. In the rational world that Bjørn Lomborg thinks we all inhabit, we would manage problems sensibly, one by one...But the real world is messier, more unpredictable - and more impatient.\"  The reasonableness of Lomborg's approach is precisely what makes it such a struggle.  How do we choose between saving lives with cancer research and saving lives with influenza vaccines.  The economics of the problem, how much good can one do in different areas with the same dollars, provides that structure.  \n\nBut it's easy - in fact it's natural - to rebel against this reasonableness.  In a talk I heard recently, Freeman Dyson (another climate skeptic) described the NASA Space Shuttle program as \"a welfare program for the aerospace industry.\"  I rebelled against that notion in the same way.  I grew up marveling at the shuttles and their magical ability to take people to space.  But a little bit of thought shows the correctness of Dyson's statement.  The Shuttles do very little beyond help the International Space Station.  The unmanned missions we send - like Kepler or the SDO - perform far more science than the Shuttle missions.  And the shuttles don't actually send humans anywhere.  We haven't been on the Moon since the 70s and even planes are getting slower than they used to be.  It's probably a positive development that NASA is shutting down the massively expensive Shuttle program - those dollars could be better spent elsewhere.  But that's not an obvious conclusion.\n\nEconomics and prioritization isn't an obvious conclusion to climate change either.  And like any book on such a politicized issue this one should be taken with a rather large grain of salt.  But that's no different than Gore's *An Inconvenient Truth* which has had as much or more criticism for incorrect or manipulated data.  The great thing about Lomborg's book is that his main theses don't actually require all the data he presents.  The validity of economics and prioritization can be built simply on human history over the last thousand years.  We now live longer and more healthy lives, we get sick less, and less children die.  Our cities are cleaner, our cars and transportation are cleaner, and we are moving towards ever-more sustainable energy sources.  A poor American is far more wealthy than *anyone* from a hundred or more years ago.  These things will continue to improve, but they will take time.\n\nA shorter version of Lomborg's message is in a [TED talk online](http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/bjorn_lomborg_sets_global_priorities.html).","html":"<p>For a change, I thought I'd do a book review just like my <a href=\"http://libonlit.blogspot.com/\">dear friend Lib</a>.  And I've just finished a book worthy of review.</p>\n\n<p>That book is The Skeptical Environmentalist by Danish economist Bjorn Lomborg.  You may have heard of Lomborg - he was brashly criticized a number of years ago for speaking against the juggernaut religion of global warming sponsored by the IPCC.</p>\n\n<p>Lomborg himself is the skeptic and he does a wonderful job of explaining the State of the World.  Each topic is broken down into quantifiable numbers and analyzed in turn.  He maintains exhaustive notes and references, usually from IPCC or UN sponsored studies, so as to rationally counter the spiced-up language of the Litany.</p>\n\n<p>The Litany is something we all know: a series of disastrous and pessimistic views on how our world is getting worse.  Deforestation, pollution, cancer, acid rain, mass extinction, ozone depletion, widespread hunger, poverty, rising oceans, ocean acidification, glacial retreat, and of course the all-important carbon concentration in the atmosphere.</p>\n\n<p>Lomborg takes all of these and more and decomposes them to understand concretely how they've changed over time.  The surprising thing about this approach is the data itself.  By every measure possible, as he presents the data, the state of humanity and our environment is better now than it has been in the past.  Pollution is decreasing, forest cover has either remained the same or increased, and the developing world is getting richer and less hungry.</p>\n\n<p>All of this data, which Lomborg so rigorously presents, is a prelude to the main thesis.</p>\n\n<p>The problem of the environment is not scientific but economic.  In this way, like many surprising solutions, the problem is turned on its side.  The developed world especially has over the past few decades begun to do a far better job in managing the environment than in the past.  The reason we are able to do this is that we are richer.  Asking questions and striving to take care of the environment is something that only the rich can afford to do.  Much of the developing world cannot do this now just like those living in squalor in 15th century London could not.  They worried about neither the exterior nor interior air quality (by the way, interior air quality has historically been far worse than exterior air quality) because they were far busier worrying about their food for tomorrow.  </p>\n\n<p>We have a largely romantic view of life in the past.  We forget the butcher shops, plague and feces in the streets of 15th century London, or the coal smoke of 19th century London, when we look at the gentrified elegance and cleanliness of 21st century London.</p>\n\n<p>As the developed world has been able to do a drastically better job at managing the environment, the solution to the problem becomes economic: continue to take the billions of poor and hungry people left in the world and make them richer and less hungry.  As the entire world becomes correspondingly richer, they will be able to better manage the environment.</p>\n\n<p>This is a radically different solution than carbon sequestering, eliminating fossil fuels, or carbon taxes.  Aside from being remarkably humanitarian, eliminating poverty and hunger is a much more efficient use of our existing money.  Carbon taxes would simply make the poor poorer and the rich who can afford things like solar panels richer.  On the other hand, working on poverty and hunger will not cost much for a huge amount of change to a huge number of people, with the added benefit of helping our environment.</p>\n\n<p>Lomborg has been massively criticized as being against the environmental movement.  But as he says, \"nobody is an anti-environmentalist.\"  Instead, he's taken a dramatic look at the resources available to us and chosen to prioritize them so as to make the most out of our human situation.  His conclusions suggest that things are better now than we think and that it's our responsibility to take a hard look at where we spend our money and make the most of it.  Every issue is not equally important and choosing not to prioritize is the same as doing so in a poor, ad-hoc fashion.</p>\n\n<p>The most interesting critic I read was Alex Kirby, a BBC journalist, who said \"What really riles me about his book is that it is so damnably reasonable. In the rational world that Bjørn Lomborg thinks we all inhabit, we would manage problems sensibly, one by one...But the real world is messier, more unpredictable - and more impatient.\"  The reasonableness of Lomborg's approach is precisely what makes it such a struggle.  How do we choose between saving lives with cancer research and saving lives with influenza vaccines.  The economics of the problem, how much good can one do in different areas with the same dollars, provides that structure.  </p>\n\n<p>But it's easy - in fact it's natural - to rebel against this reasonableness.  In a talk I heard recently, Freeman Dyson (another climate skeptic) described the NASA Space Shuttle program as \"a welfare program for the aerospace industry.\"  I rebelled against that notion in the same way.

Actually, she looked desperate to get out of there, to go feel the sun on her face and enjoy the day.  The mother was also about what you expect.

If you've never met a Franciscan, they are a sight.  The focus of their lives is in full view at all times.  They have shaved heads, long beards, and rough long robes tied with a Rosary.  They wear either old sandals or go barefoot.  This clothing - and their Rosary - is all they own.  They beg for or live off of donation for everything, including food and shelter.  \n\nThis sort of life sounds completely crazy, especially to most twenty year olds.  I had one brief conversation with one of the Franciscan Friars there.  He was a bear of a man, 6'6\" barefoot and 300 lbs and a foot long black beard.  But he glowed with life.  It absolutely radiated out from him.  \n\nThat one conversation completely changed my perspective not only on Franciscans, but on the credibility of priests and the Church.

The conclusion - that very rich people can and do buy political power - could be construed as conspiracy-theoretic.  I think it's more of a sad sarcasm about the difference between most of the population and the people that play politics.\n\nBut the politicians need most of the population.  Literally.  The notion of democracy suggests that the politicians, at least temporarily, have the ear of the majority.  I don't mean to be pessimistic, but let me rattle off some facts about the majority, as presented by some statistics about the median American (the difference between a majority and an average is significant, but is reasonable here):\n\n-  $46,000 salary\n-  2.7 hours of TV per day\n-  $18,000 in total savings (retirement too)\n-  $5,100 in credit card debt\n-  85% have a high school degree, only 27% have a college degree\n\nThese are averages of course, and statistics can be difficult to deal with.  Nevertheless, let us compare these to averages across Congress:\n\n-  $175,000-$220,000 salary\n-  $920,000 average net worth\n-  237 are millionaires\n-  95% have college degrees, somewhere around 70% have advanced degrees\n\nThese are not the same segments of the population, and that's fine by me.  To put it more bluntly, the average American has a very average education, almost no savings for retirement, a huge amount of debt compared to their salary and likes very much to soak up TV on their couch.  Congressional members, on the other hand, are very well educated and reasoned people who are typically set financially for life and have no time or effort to waste on boring hobbies like TV.  So why does the one group try so desperately to mollify the other?  And why do they also insist on the myth that they are just like the average American?  If they were, I wouldn't elect them.\n\nI realized recently that this single problem is my whole issue with politics today.  It was this comment of Obama's that did it; he said, \n\t\"I'm not going to remove these energy investments when so many taxpaying citizens \n\tare feeling pain at the [gas] pump.\".  \nHe was defending some government \"investments\" (spending) that the Republicans wanted gone as part of the debate over raising the debt ceiling. \n\nThere are three problems with this statement:  \n\n1. The two things have nothing to do with each other.  \n2.  Obama knows it.  \n3.  His audience (largely) doesn't.\n\nThis is called pandering, and it's loathsome standard practice, and has been around as long as government.  TV, radio, and media only make it worse.  \n\nNPR also recently had a small forum on the chances of Jon Huntsman, the recently announced Republican candidate from Utah.  They all agreed that, although Huntsman might be the most popular and likable in a general election, he first had to navigate the Republican waters to achieve the nomination.  In other words, he had pander to a specific political base before re-aligning himself to pander to the country at large.  There's a good possibility Obama could be a one-term president, he certainly isn't going to enter this election year looking great, so I couldn't believe the Republicans would hamstring a nomination **at all**.  \n\nBut unfortunately, to get the nomination of a party the morass of the RNC or DNC must be assuaged.  Candidates must be sufficiently aligned with the party line to be in line for the seat.  Just ask Joe Lieberman.\n\nPandering is, by definition, the act of debasing a particular issue into an easily readable scale for a general audience.  The audience isn't always the entire population; as we've seen it can be the party bases, or perhaps even smaller segments too.  \n\nFor well-reasoned political discourse, this is the exact opposite of what should happen.  Our elected leaders are just that - our leaders.  They are the cream of the crop: independently successful, highly educated and charismatic.  Instead of coming down to our average level, shouldn't they be helping to illuminate the nature of the debate for us?\n\nThis is an achievable goal.  If it wasn't, maybe democracy wouldn't be such a beautiful ideal.  Here are a couple of thoughts that could help.\n\n#### Beware one-dimensional spectrums\n\nLiberal----Conservative.  Rich----Poor.  Green----Greedy.  These labels almost always have no meaning for one very good reason.  They are totally subjective.  No matter where the observer sits on the spectrum, the labels mean the people to their right for one label and the people to their left for the other.  I call this the Highway Test, because speed on the highway is another example of a one-dimensional spectrum.  A lot of people think that anyone going faster than them on the highway is a maniac but anyone going slower is stopping up traffic and needs to get over a lane.  Your perspective is 100% subjective, since you don't always go the perfect speed either, and your assumptions mean **you have no idea what you're talking about**.  If you have this reaction on the highway, I'm sorry, you're probably not the best driver, or at the least you can't look at a situation very objectively.  \n\nTaxes are an example of this in the public realm.  Democrats like more taxes and Republicans like less, right?  Which taxes?  Corporate income tax or individual income tax?  Corporate deductions or subsidies?  What about mulitnational corporations based in the US?  Multinationals based outside the US?  More taxes or less deductions?  More complicated or more general?  Value Added taxes or sales tax or real estate tax or gas tax or state tax?  What about the effect of taxes on inflation?  On government spending?  On the bond market?  How does the Federal Reserve act?  Are the projections based on totals or baseline?  On law or policy?\n\nTaxes aren't one-dimensional, despite sound bytes.  Beware anything that seems one-dimensional.  If it is, you probably don't have the whole picture yet.\n\n#### Open Government\n\nOne of the reasons subjects become one-dimensional is that both politicians and media push them into easily consumable snippets.  There's definitely no quick solution for this, but there is an easy, if long, path to success: learn the issues.  Fight partisanship with knowledge.  An informed public is one who can see through a politician's veil (or CNN or Fox News' veil for that matter), who can understand the underlying principles and reason about them.  After all, isn't an informed vote the original reason for public education in our country?\n\nBut beyond education, the public needs help in understanding the principles of politicians.  We need more open-source government and more non-partisan sources.  OpenCongress and OpenSecrets and FiveThirtyEight and CSPAN (yes, CSPAN) do wonders for understanding both the issues that politicians debate, how they debate them, and how they deal with them.  The closer you get to primary sources, the more complete your picture.\n\nOn a related note, I only get news from two real sources: [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/) and [Google News](http://news.google.com/).  I don't ever watch TV news, it's dreadful and a complete waste of time.  Google News is developed algorithmically to have a listing of the most recent and most important news in the world.  Meanwhile, Hacker News is a social news aggregator site catering to a fairly narrow and nerdy mindshare, which is exactly what keeps it so interesting.  The percentage of links of interest to me on Hacker News far outweighs the front page of any news site or even a more general aggregator site like Digg or Reddit.\n\nThe one thing that's missing from news is slow news.  The instant consumption of everything today from Twitter, TV, Facebook and Google leaves a huge hole for a very neutral and factual site that describes what happened after it happened.  For example, to better understand the debt ceiling and budget comedy in Congress, I turned to an [excellent EconTalk podcast with Keith Hennessey](http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2011/07/hennessey_on_th.html) that explained the whole thing.  The minimum delay for a topic on this news site would be one week after something happens.  The coverage would be extensive and would focus on emphatically **not** spinning the story.  It would also include lots of factual information that people tend to miss, for example the [USGS map of recent earthquakes around the world](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/) and long term weather patterns.  If I built this thing, I'd actually call it SlowNews.  The closest thing I've found so far is the right hand column of the main Wikipedia page.\n\n#### Long Term Thinking\n\nWhen Kennedy announced that NASA would take a person to the moon, he was thinking ten years out and beyond his own presidency.  When Jefferson bought the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, he was thinking far beyond the political landscape of 1803.  These sorts of visionaries seem to have left our public offices.  At the very least, we the public don't hear much about their visions if they exist.\n\nWe need this long term vision.  Instead of arguing about wanting to get rid of Social Security and Medicare, we need to talk realistically about what they will look like in 20 or 40 years.  They cannot continue forever at current levels, especially with the Baby Boomers coming into play.  Instead of pandering for the senior vote now, I'd love to hear more about taking care of the seniors 20 years from now.\n\nWe need to face these issues as long term challenges rather than short term myopic fixes that span election terms.  Imagine what we could do with 50 years for the environment, for energy, and for wealth.  We will likely continue to do better than we do now, but wouldn't it be great to optimize?  This is not a call for central planning, but for honest and long-term thinking.\n\n#### Incumbency\n\nThe reason both sides pander for the senior contingent is because they vote.  They have quite a voting block.  And politicians, more than anything else it seems, want your vote.  Warren Buffet had a great quote about the deficit a couple weeks ago:\n\n\tI could end the deficit in 5 minutes. You just pass a law that says that anytime there is \n\ta deficit of more than 3% of GDP all sitting members of congress are ineligible for reelection.”  \n\nMaybe that's not such a bad idea.  Our elected politicians are there to show us the path forward, not perpetuate their position.  If they're not doing the job, let's ditch them.  I've been reading recently about [Vickrey auctions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction) and how they've been used by Google and others to raise efficacy standards for both buyers and sellers.  We've relied on the [very first pass at incumbency and elections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_limits_in_the_United_States#Term_limits_in_the_Constitution) for a long time.  What would a second pass look like?  (If anyone has any resources, I would love to understand more about how incumbency affects the political process and how it might change in the future.)\n\nCongress should raise the bar, not drop down into averages and mediocrity.\n\nSome stat sources:\n\n-  (http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/hhinc/new02_001.htm)\n-  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_Joe)\n-  (http://www.hoffmanbrinker.com/credit-card-debt-statistics.html)\n-  (http://www.retirement-income.net/blog/retirement-savings-statistics/average-retirement-savings-all-measurements-lead-to-the-same-conclusion/)\n-  (http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/averages.php)\n-  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_the_111th_United_States_Congress#Education)","html":"<p>Awhile back, I wrote about <a href=\"http://www.infiniteabyss.org/2011/04/09/buying_power.html\">some of my frustrations</a> with the way our political parties go back and forth across their perceived spectrums without actually saying much.  The conclusion - that very rich people can and do buy political power - could be construed as conspiracy-theoretic.  I think it's more of a sad sarcasm about the difference between most of the population and the people that play politics.</p>\n\n<p>But the politicians need most of the population.  Literally.  The notion of democracy suggests that the politicians, at least temporarily, have the ear of the majority.  I don't mean to be pessimistic, but let me rattle off some facts about the majority, as presented by some statistics about the median American (the difference between a majority and an average is significant, but is reasonable here):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$46,000 salary</li>\n<li>2.7 hours of TV per day</li>\n<li>$18,000 in total savings (retirement too)</li>\n<li>$5,100 in credit card debt</li>\n<li>85% have a high school degree, only 27% have a college degree</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are averages of course, and statistics can be difficult to deal with.  Nevertheless, let us compare these to averages across Congress:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$175,000-$220,000 salary</li>\n<li>$920,000 average net worth</li>\n<li>237 are millionaires</li>\n<li>95% have college degrees, somewhere around 70% have advanced degrees</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are not the same segments of the population, and that's fine by me.  To put it more bluntly, the average American has a very average education, almost no savings for retirement, a huge amount of debt compared to their salary and likes very much to soak up TV on their couch.  Congressional members, on the other hand, are very well educated and reasoned people who are typically set financially for life and have no time or effort to waste on boring hobbies like TV.  So why does the one group try so desperately to mollify the other?  And why do they also insist on the myth that they are just like the average American?  If they were, I wouldn't elect them.</p>\n\n<p>I realized recently that this single problem is my whole issue with politics today.  It was this comment of Obama's that did it; he said, <br />\n    \"I'm not going to remove these energy investments when so many taxpaying citizens \n    are feeling pain at the [gas] pump.\". <br />\nHe was defending some government \"investments\" (spending) that the Republicans wanted gone as part of the debate over raising the debt ceiling. </p>\n\n<p>There are three problems with this statement:  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The two things have nothing to do with each other.  </li>\n<li>Obama knows it.  </li>\n<li>His audience (largely) doesn't.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is called pandering, and it's loathsome standard practice, and has been around as long as government.  TV, radio, and media only make it worse.  </p>\n\n<p>NPR also recently had a small forum on the chances of Jon Huntsman, the recently announced Republican candidate from Utah.  They all agreed that, although Huntsman might be the most popular and likable in a general election, he first had to navigate the Republican waters to achieve the nomination.  In other words, he had pander to a specific political base before re-aligning himself to pander to the country at large.  There's a good possibility Obama could be a one-term president, he certainly isn't going to enter this election year looking great, so I couldn't believe the Republicans would hamstring a nomination <strong>at all</strong>.  </p>\n\n<p>But unfortunately, to get the nomination of a party the morass of the RNC or DNC must be assuaged.  Candidates must be sufficiently aligned with the party line to be in line for the seat.  Just ask Joe Lieberman.</p>\n\n<p>Pandering is, by definition, the act of debasing a particular issue into an easily readable scale for a general audience.  The audience isn't always the entire population; as we've seen it can be the party bases, or perhaps even smaller segments too.  </p>\n\n<p>For well-reasoned political discourse, this is the exact opposite of what should happen.  Our elected leaders are just that - our leaders.  They are the cream of the crop: independently successful, highly educated and charismatic.  Instead of coming down to our average level, shouldn't they be helping to illuminate the nature of the debate for us?</p>\n\n<p>This is an achievable goal.  If it wasn't, maybe democracy wouldn't be such a beautiful ideal.  Here are a couple of thoughts that could help.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"bewareonedimensionalspectrums\">Beware one-dimensional spectrums</h4>\n\n<p>Liberal----Conservative.  Rich----Poor.  Green----Greedy.  These labels almost always have no meaning for one very good reason.  They are totally subjective.  No matter where the observer sits on the spectrum, the labels mean the people to their right for one label and the people to their left for the other.  I call this the Highway Test, because speed on the highway is another example of a one-dimensional spectrum.  A lot of people think that anyone going faster than them on the highway is a maniac but anyone going slower is stopping up traffic and needs to get over a lane.  Your perspective is 100% subjective, since you don't always go the perfect speed either, and your assumptions mean <strong>you have no idea what you're talking about</strong>.  If you have this reaction on the highway, I'm sorry, you're probably not the best driver, or at the least you can't look at a situation very objectively.  </p>\n\n<p>Taxes are an example of this in the public realm.  Democrats like more taxes and Republicans like less, right?  Which taxes?  Corporate income tax or individual income tax?  Corporate deductions or subsidies?  What about mulitnational corporations based in the US?  Multinationals based outside the US?  More taxes or less deductions?  More complicated or more general?  Value Added taxes or sales tax or real estate tax or gas tax or state tax?  What about the effect of taxes on inflation?  On government spending?  On the bond market?  How does the Federal Reserve act?  Are the projections based on totals or baseline?  On law or policy?</p>\n\n<p>Taxes aren't one-dimensional, despite sound bytes.  Beware anything that seems one-dimensional.  If it is, you probably don't have the whole picture yet.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"opengovernment\">Open Government</h4>\n\n<p>One of the reasons subjects become one-dimensional is that both politicians and media push them into easily consumable snippets.  There's definitely no quick solution for this, but there is an easy, if long, path to success: learn the issues.  Fight partisanship with knowledge.  An informed public is one who can see through a politician's veil (or CNN or Fox News' veil for that matter), who can understand the underlying principles and reason about them.  After all, isn't an informed vote the original reason for public education in our country?</p>\n\n<p>But beyond education, the public needs help in understanding the principles of politicians.  We need more open-source government and more non-partisan sources.  OpenCongress and OpenSecrets and FiveThirtyEight and CSPAN (yes, CSPAN) do wonders for understanding both the issues that politicians debate, how they debate them, and how they deal with them.  The closer you get to primary sources, the more complete your picture.</p>\n\n<p>On a related note, I only get news from two real sources: <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/\">Hacker News</a> and <a href=\"http://news.google.com/\">Google News</a>.  I don't ever watch TV news, it's dreadful and a complete waste of time.  Google News is developed algorithmically to have a listing of the most recent and most important news in the world.  Meanwhile, Hacker News is a social news aggregator site catering to a fairly narrow and nerdy mindshare, which is exactly what keeps it so interesting.  The percentage of links of interest to me on Hacker News far outweighs the front page of any news site or even a more general aggregator site like Digg or Reddit.</p>\n\n<p>The one thing that's missing from news is slow news.  The instant consumption of everything today from Twitter, TV, Facebook and Google leaves a huge hole for a very neutral and factual site that describes what happened after it happened.  For example, to better understand the debt ceiling and budget comedy in Congress, I turned to an <a href=\"http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2011/07/hennessey_on_th.html\">excellent EconTalk podcast with Keith Hennessey</a> that explained the whole thing.

Reich has clearly thought about this a lot, but my first reaction is that nobody can really explain what's going on in 2 minutes.  After watching it, I still think it's impossible.  Here's why:\n\nMy biggest problem with his quick thinking is that most of those super rich he talks about in the last thirty years **earned** their money.  The economy since 1980 has been a knowledge economy, and that doesn't follow the more traditional [daddy model of wealth](http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html) creation.  In large part, those super rich didn't take away wealth from the average worker to get their money.  They innovated and prospered, and so did the average consumer.  Take a look at the [Forbes 400](http://www.forbes.com/wealth/forbes-400/) as an example dataset.  Look where all that wealth came from - 45 alone are from [Technology](http://www.forbes.com/wealth/forbes-400/list?industry=6&state=).  You are richer now because Steve Jobs made billions on iPods.  I am richer now because of Page and Brin's search engine.  They made the world better, not worse.  A lot better.  Why shouldn't they prosper?  Why shouldn't the early Googler millionaires prosper?  There will always be exceptions to this - I count [3 billionaires](http://www.forbes.com/wealth/forbes-400/list?industry=45&state=) who made their money from casinos.  We should be willing to accept that, given the huge upside from other wealthy folks.  And even the casino owners are typically shrewd businessmen who worked for their money.\n\nIt sort of makes sense to me that the average worker salary has remained fixed when adjusting for inflation.  They're the average.  Their great gain in wealth comes not from a huge increase in wages, but from what those wages are able to buy.  Their productivity, as the average, may not warrant higher wages.  Those workers who can make great gains in productivity (we're talking orders of magnitude, not small percentage increases), they're the ones who make the tremendous leap in income possible today.\n\nTake this manufacturing tale as an example.  Certainly an average machine operator in a plant doing good work should earn a respectable wage.  But say there's another worker who really knows his stuff.  He understands how the machines operate intimately and has some improvements to suggest.  So he seeks a machine design firm and goes into business building the next generation machine that improves plant productivity 20% and drops machine operator error 15%.  He has increased not only his own wealth exponentially, but also the capability of the companies that use his machines, and the consumer who will now except a lower price for the same product because it costs less to make.\n\nThe next problem is the statistical model of saying that the super rich own more of the wealth in the country.  Well, yeah.  In a system of only positive numbers, the only place large variation happens is when you get farther away from zero.  This sort of statistic is a red herring.  The very rich got rich faster - the world has changed quickly - but the average person has gotten richer too, if not in inflation adjusted wages, than in what those wages can buy.  Look around at all your gadgets and tell me that's not true.  Our minimum standard of living is far higher than 1980.\n\nThe taxes is where I start to agree.  Our tax code just SUCKS.  It's 9,000 pages.  If you're not using an accountant, you're missing out.  If you don't have some way to use capital gains, you're missing out.  FICA only goes up to $106,800 in payroll.  And the top tax bracket hits at \"only\" $379,150.  In a country with millions of millionaires, that's just not enough granularity.  There absolutely should be a higher tax bracket for the super rich.  \n\nBut, saying the rich don't pay their fair share is ridiculous.  Reich says the top 1% own 40% of the country's wealth.  They also pay 34% of all the income taxes.  The top 5% pay 54%.  The bottom 50% of earners, literally everyone below average, pays less than 5% of taxes total.  (2002, from US Treasury Office of Tax Analysis)\n\nBudget deficits are definitely a big problem today.  But the discretionary spending examples he provides - schools and roads - are superfluous.  The big problems are the old standbys: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and our two wars.  The wars have a guaranteed sunset to their cost (at some point), so it's important that we don't get distracted by the effect that they make in the next five years.  The big entitlement programs, on the other hand, are enormous and have no end in sight.  Our budget deficits are a problem, but it's not just low taxes that are the problem.\n\nI take \"vast middle class\" to mean the huge number of people in between those below the poverty line and millionaires.  All these people aren't one big class, there's too much variability.  \n\nThe phrase \"unable to borrow as it did before\" is a really veiled point.  The whole reason the middle class is described as the driver of the economy is it's purchasing power, which is driven directly by the debt the middle class is willing to take on for it's lifestyle.  Do you like this conclusion?  I don't.  If the middle class drives the economy by \"buying and borrowing\", then there's a cyclic argument to the very debt crisis that we're in now.\n\nOh that's right, the Fed can print money whenever it's needed.  Who cares about our tax revenue, bring on inflation!\n\nThere's a lot he's right about, especially the changes in the economy since 1980 (in my mind, a net positive) and the problems with taxes.  But my main conclusion is actually unrelated:  Left-minded public figures persuade the middle class (and thus the vote) by catering to their perception of self-importance as the main consumer-driven, debt-driven economic force.  Meanwhile, right-minded public figures persuade by catering to the independence of the middle-class.  Our stand-off between entitlement programs and taxes at this point is just a symptom of the fight for elected offices.\n\nThe full 2:15 video:\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/JTzMqm2TwgE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n","html":"<p>I've seen <a href=\"http://front.moveon.org/scribbling-sharpie-illustrates-the-truth-about-our-economy/\">this 2 minute economic summation from Robert Reich</a> floating around in a bunch of different places and it has bugged me, so I've been trying to figure out why.

Our stand-off between entitlement programs and taxes at this point is just a symptom of the fight for elected offices.</p>\n\n<p>The full 2:15 video:  </p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/JTzMqm2TwgE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"de_DE","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2011-08-15T03:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2011-08-15T03:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2011-08-15T03:00:00.000Z","published_by":1,"visibility":"public","mobiledoc":null,"amp":null},{"id":63,"uuid":"3e2b3acf-7553-43e6-b5a7-0b6e9537c71b","title":"What You'll Wish You'd Known","slug":"known","markdown":"An [Ask PG](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2982185) thread on Hacker News had a [comment](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2982562) so poignant I felt inclined to repost it here.

It's enough to turn any grown man into a bumbling, drooling kid.  It's got perfect lines, an elegant interior and a motor to die for.  My Dad was in heaven.\n\nThe Ferrari 458 Italia is the reigning champion of my own Ferrari dreams.  I got to see a couple in person recently at the Baltimore Grand Prix.  The sounds they make are otherworldly.  Their shape is fiendish yet beautiful.  They met my expectation and I was in love.  I was ready to put on my linen pants, half-open polo shirt and leather moccasins and fly down the Cote d'Azur to Monaco for a night of gambling and high living.\n\n![458](http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/autopia/2009/09/ferrari_458_02.jpg)\n\nBut I realized recently that I'll never own one.  I'll also never own a Pagani, a Rolls Royce, a Lamborghini or any number of other exotic and rare luxury sportscars.  And I think the reasons why are important.\n\nPeople overvalue stuff.  In the past when simply building any car was a highly innovative achievement, the higher end marques had significant advantages in build quality, beauty, and performance.  They don't anymore.  The cars that Ferrari and Rolls Royce produce are made from either currently expensive technology or handmade craftsmanship.  Technology has made the production of almost all cars completely streamlined.  The average sedan is CAD designed, wind tunnelled and has far more technology than a Ferrari of even the mid-90s.  As Jeremy Clarkson says, \"handmade is just a clever way of saying the doors will fall off.\"  You can't duplicate handmade, by definition, but machines today are actually better than hands.  The idea of handmade craftsmanship is simply a measure of exclusivity.  Technology on the other hand is evolving at a faster and faster rate.  The average Kia today has far more and better features than the super exclusive cars of twenty or thirty years ago, and a very affordable sportscar today is probably faster than a vintage Ferrari.\n\nWhat super luxury cars do have is style.  They are bold and beautiful, sexy and erotic, elegant and sumptuous.  Unfortunately, it's not technology that creates this difference, it's the abilities and flexibilities of their designers.  Even the carbon composite body of the McLaren F1, that heavenly bastion of racing-induced design in the 90s, is old hat.  I know people that make carbon door skins in their garage now.  Of course, cheap cars can have style.  The only reasons a cheap car is ugly today is shoddy committee-driven design or the belief by the maker that the average consumer *actually wants* a beige Camry.  GM pioneered this mentality and they've been dealing with it for decades.  They make cars lazily.  They've survived this long because most people actually don't care.  That and branding.\n\nI'm probably being a little unfair to the exotic cars.  They are amazing machines with incredible technology.  Carbon ceramic brakes, double clutch gearboxes, magneto-rheological shocks, launch control, amazing differentials, carbon everything, etc.  A lot of this is still too expensive for lesser cars.  But it's all coming very soon.\n\nAnd that's the problem with my fantasy Ferrari.  **The root of a Ferrari's utility is exclusivity, and it's a facade built on the perception of performance.**  A Ferrari is actually a harbinger of the future.\n\nIn other words, what your exclusive $350K buys you is a glimpse into what the technology of the future might be.  And quite frankly, I can get what I need of that by watching the cars get flogged on Top Gear.\n\nWhich is why I love that show along with the rest of the automotive population.  I got to watch them absolutely thrash a 458 Italia.  If I owned that car, I would almost always baby it.  I would expect it to be less reliable than a fast car a fifth of it's price.  I would drive it less.  Like most owners, the reality would be far less exciting than my wonderful built-up fantasy.  I'd still wear a prancing horse hat of course, and leather moccasins.\n\nFor the same reasons, I don't really understand the Barret Jackson collector crowd either.  It's like a more upscale and focused Pawn Stars.  For various historical reasons, people overvalue the crap out of these bygone rocketships.  The prices get remarkably inflated in the same way as a Picasso or a Klimt painting: brand.  When you buy a COPO Camaro you are effectively buying a remarkably large objet d'art based on a brand name.  If you have fond memories of the 60s and you are incredibly rich, it gives you a glimpse into the past instead of the future.. and maybe it's worth it.  I doubt it.\n\nIn popular culture, the allure of the Ferrari, the Rolls Royce, and the COPO Camaro to the automotive masses are all driven by branding.  Aside from rattling off specs, people don't actually have a clue about any of these Things.  They never really get to experience them.  They know them because their branding is so incredibly strong that they've become famous.\n\nBranding is what actually sells today.

Brand drives exclusivity, and cost. *1\n\nSo I'm a performance nut.  If not a Ferrari, what would I buy?  Well I'll tell you.  I want a car that can perform unbelievably well.  But I also want to be a better driver.  I want to *learn how to use everything the car has*.  So I'll stick with a cheaper car that I don't feel bad bruising up a bit in the pursuit of performance.  Those ALMS Ferrari race teams can keep their 458 Italias and multimillion dollar budgets.  You know what I want?  I want a 58 Bugeye Sprite.

It has a Mazda 13B rotary motor with upwards of 400 hp.  It runs Goodyear slicks from a Formula Atlantic and weighs 1800 lbs.  It's a complete rocketship and one of my favorite cars on planet earth.  I'd much rather have it than a Ferrari.  For SCCA Solo, an amateur form of motorsport that lets you push the limit of a car, this is about as good as it gets.  It's maybe a fifth of the price of a new Ferrari and way faster.\n\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/To0EZq_poIQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\nI'm not quite ready for that level of prep or budget.

It's built to be run hard and performs really well.  It's common enough that we don't mind if it gets a beating.  When it comes right down to it, I'll take the smell of rubber and competition over a lazy afternoon drive in my leather moccasins any day.\n\n### Where We're Going\n\nInterestingly, car companies seem to be converging towards a really fascinating middle ground of luxury, performance and technology.  BMW, Mercedes, and Porsche have started on the topside of this layer and moved downmarket.  Toyota, Nissan, and Honda split off Lexus, Infiniti, and Acura respectively to move upmarket.  They're all driving towards the same segment - a sweet spot where a car has every need you could ask for, including style and class, and exudes a craftsmanship that provides the same facade of exclusivity.  You can still see the origins of this movement in the relative brand perceptions.  Here the consumer sees the amalgam of all the style, technology, image and speed they want along with the reliability, lack of concern and everyday quality they need.  And the topside of this market is still a harbinger of the future.  A Mercedes S550 shows the quality and features of a more average sedan ten years from now, where a Rolls Royce shows it twenty five years from now.\n\nOf course, if everyone converges to this class of vehicle, the exclusivity and class arguments get tossed out the window, but I wonder if the average consumer will ever really notice?  We're far richer than ever before, and we all can afford nicer cars than we used to.  We're happy, or will be if we can avoid the problem of brand.  Functionally, all of these cars are so advanced that the only way they differ is in brand and style.\n\nThis also leaves an interesting niche market at the lower end of the spectrum.  You probably won't see a ton of it in the States, but in India, Brazil or other places around the world it could explode.  It's the extremely cheap \"transportation only\" market.  In this segment, cars can be bare-bones, reliable boxes that get a set of people around.  No power windows, locks, fancy stereos, navigation, or leather.  [Tata Motors](http://www.tatamotors.com/) is starting up and they might have the right idea.  I bet they won't be the last.\n\nIn the meantime, I'm happy to sit in my relatively normal band of motoring.  Despite whatever wealth I get lucky enough to accumulate - even if it ends up being millions of dollars - I will never own that Ferrari.  I will stick to BMWs or Nissans, Mercedes or Hondas, and relish in a much cheaper and still extremely fast real car to satisfy my hunger for speed.  The real thing is always better than a wet dream.\n\n\n\n*1 It's possible to drive brand on cheapness too, like Walmart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","html":"<p>Over the weekend, my Dad went on a joy ride in a buddy's brand new Ferrari California, a rare and exquisite moment in any car guy's life.

The show was great, but the crowd was ridiculous.  Annoying kids flinging sand everywhere, loud and drunk men, smokers, and obnoxious mothers seemed prevalent.  I usually get a little flustered in crowds, and my \"bah humbug!\" was definitely showing itself that day.  Then I came to a new realization, and my annoyance floated away.\n\nAs crowds grow in size, the number of people in the crowd defined under any sort of (arbitrary) label, including stupidity, intelligence, obnoxiousness, or quietness increases also.  Unfortunately, *smart* or *quiet* are harder to pick out than *stupid* or *annoying*, where harder means that it takes longer to determine.  You can tell fairly quickly if someone falls under your definition of stupid, but it can take quite awhile to determine if they are smart.\n\nWe don't usually realize this because of one simple thing.  Humans are dreadfully bad at understanding what random actually means.  [Peter Norvig described this amazingly well](http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html) with the following example.  He says \"Consider the following three plots. In one of the plots each of the blue points is sampled with equal probability from the entire square.

The show was great, but the crowd was ridiculous.  Annoying kids flinging sand everywhere, loud and drunk men, smokers, and obnoxious mothers seemed prevalent.  I usually get a little flustered in crowds, and my \"bah humbug!\" was definitely showing itself that day.  Then I came to a new realization, and my annoyance floated away.</p>\n\n<p>As crowds grow in size, the number of people in the crowd defined under any sort of (arbitrary) label, including stupidity, intelligence, obnoxiousness, or quietness increases also.  Unfortunately, <em>smart</em> or <em>quiet</em> are harder to pick out than <em>stupid</em> or <em>annoying</em>, where harder means that it takes longer to determine.  You can tell fairly quickly if someone falls under your definition of stupid, but it can take quite awhile to determine if they are smart.</p>\n\n<p>We don't usually realize this because of one simple thing.  Humans are dreadfully bad at understanding what random actually means.  <a href=\"http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html\">Peter Norvig described this amazingly well</a> with the following example.  He says \"Consider the following three plots. In one of the plots each of the blue points is sampled with equal probability from the entire square. Which one is it?\"</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://norvig.com/plot1.png\" height=\"138\" width=\"190\" /> <br />\n<img src=\"http://norvig.com/plot2.png\" height=\"138\" width=\"190\" /> <br />\n<img src=\"http://norvig.com/plot3.png\" height=\"138\" width=\"190\" /></p>\n\n<p>Most people pick the one on the right.

Everyone uses it.  It becomes the basic hub of your entire internet presence.  Your subscriptions from every service hit your email.  Anything you order online goes to email.  Anything you register for goes to email.  Bills go to email.  Important FB or Twitter news goes to email.  Messages from friends, family, and coworkers goes to email.  Yet it still surprises me how badly most people manage their email.  Most are still stuck using Outlook, or Hotmail/Comcast/Yahoo.  Many use GMail, but only in a rudimentary fashion.  (Interestingly, someone did a study that suggested you can guess the age of someone based on which email service they use, which I can't find right now.)\n\nThe great thing about GMail is how easy it is to use well.  Most people don't, even fairly technical people.  They still have 12,000 things in their Inbox, mostly Groupon/coupon/subscription spams.  Given how ubiquitous email is, it's sort of insane to use it so poorly.  So this is a story about how I use GMail.  I've explained or showed it to enough people - technical and non-technical alike - to believe it relevant to others.  I don't claim to know or use all its powers, and this is not a One True Way article.  It's simply something that has worked well for me.  If it works well for you, awesome.\n\nThe key behind using a system well is psychology.  All the cool features in the world won't help change your habits.  I'm pretty ruthless about maintaining Labels, Filters and a small Inbox.  My Inbox acts as a sort of todo list.  It's the set of the top things I have to think about right now.  When it gets up to more than 30 or so things, I start trimming.  \n\n### Security\n\nIf I started anywhere else, I'd be remiss.  Likely this is the hub of your presence online - you should secure it.\n\nThe first thing this means is you should have two GMail accounts.  Your primary account, and a second completely unused account.  God forbid anyone ever gets a hold of your account, GMail has a mechanism to send confirmation to a secondary address that allows you to regain control.  I had to use this once when I was more foolish with passwords, and I was really happy it was there.\n\n#### Passwords\n\nPeople still use [crazy simple](http://tenfoottable.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/top20passwords.png) passwords.  Come on, you can do better.  The rules are simple: passwords should be fairly long and have some different characters in it.  At least 10 characters, and 15-20 is better.  And get some numbers and punctuation in there.  There are plenty of schemes to keep them memorable. \n\n![XKCD Passwords - not perfect, but good](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png)\n\nYour GMail password shouldn't be used for anything else.  Ever.  Your secondary email account password should be different, as should your FB, Twitter or whatever others.  Your financial passwords should be different yet again.  If this all sounds like a pain (which it can be), investigate some solutions like [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword), which has become a great tool for me.\n\nGMail started offering two-factor authentication not long ago too.  I haven't added this yet, but it's on my radar screen.  \n\n### Conversations\n\nAnytime I see Outlook and most web-based email clients, I cringe at all the \"Re: \", \"Re: re: Fwd: ZOMG\", and \"Re: re: re: RE RE: Fwd: Re: re: re: re: fwd: fwd: wat?\".  What is that crap?  It's been around since the beginning, but GMail's conversation view still deems mention.  I've got 22 items in my inbox right now, which, without conversation, would be more like 120.  And when you open these up, they do a great job at maintaining new message integrity.  So if you're new message in a huge chain of replies contains all the previous replies, those are safely tucked away and hidden, and you can differentiate the flow of the conversation very easily.  This feels like old hat to me and many others now, but I'm still taken aback by how many people are stuck with the old Outlook mentality.\n\nFor example, this is like 20 SMS messages.   \n![Hey call me](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhyrr/mhyrr.github.com/master/images/conversations.jpg)  \n\n### Archive\n\nArchive all your email.  You can search and find stuff all the time.  This was the original reason for GMail: search, and it's so useful.  Space isn't exactly an issue here.  I've been using GMail excessively since 2005 and I'm 63% full.\n\n![Not full yet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhyrr/mhyrr.github.com/master/images/gmailsize.jpg)   \n\nRecently, I've amended this slightly.  If some subscription thing or a monthly newsletter comes in and I know I'll never see it again, I'll delete it.  But that's it.  \n\nArchiving everything means you'll have a lot of information up in the GMail service, which may be a little nerve-racking.  For a long time I used a mail client to do local backups, but I've given that up now.  Google has an inherent desire to be ruthlessly careful with your data: happy customers.  But aside from that, I'm still looking into [Backupify](https://www.backupify.com/) as a backup solution.\n\n### Multiple Accounts\n\nIf you need multiple accounts, it's easy to host in GMail.  You can incorporate email from another service or domain, but given the choice, it's easier to just use multiple GMail accounts.  You can bring them in from *Accounts and Import* in Settings.  When you compose an email, the *From* field will have a simple drop-down menu to choose your address.  The defaults for this are all pretty smart.  I only ever check my one email account, which consolidates email from several accounts.  If I reply to something from a different address, the reply is automatically from my receiving address.  Piece of cake.\n\n### Labels\n\nOMG, people still use vast complicated folder structures?  Labels are only slightly different, but it's huge in practice.  The difference is: a single email may have more than one label, whereas it may be put in only one folder.\n\nThis way, my bank statement can be filed under Online Bills, Bank, and Financials.  A company email gets filed under my company label (which effectively doubles as an Inbox for that email address), and the relevant topic area.  \n\nSuch a simple change, but such a big difference in practice.  I have tons of labels for everything from SMS conversations, to convenient shortcut labels for specific people like my wife, labels for online accounts, online orders, good conversations with friends, travel, and my writing ideas and drafts.  It's just easy.\n\n### Filters\n\nOrganizing all this wouldn't be easy if it weren't for Filters.  Almost all of my labels have one or more filters which automagically add the proper labels.  This keeps all my online bill statements, Amazon orders, text messages, company email, car and racing conversations, and wine newsletters nicely organized.  It's not hard to setup and it's worth a touch of trouble to keep life organized.\n\n![iTunes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhyrr/mhyrr.github.com/master/images/ituneslabel.jpg)  \n\n### Themes\n\nI use Preview (Dense).  Busy themes take away from the whole point, which is a clean and tidy environment.  \n\n### Labs\n\nThe Labs area has some useful little add-ons.  Here's my list:\n\n* Canned Responses: Useful for multiple signatures, and common emails.\n* Custom Date Formats: There's 24 hours in a day, not 12.\n* Inserting Images\n* Move Icon Column: Slots the attachment icon right next to the Star, way easier to see.\n* Right-side chat: It's on the right side now.\n\n### Rapportive\n\nI use [Rapportive](https://rapportive.com/) on my home computers, which is a sidebar that provides information about the other people in conversations, including social media connections.  It's been pretty useful, but I don't consider it a must have.  Google has injected their own version in the sidebar too, with recent emails and shared documents that's nice too.\n\n### Google Sync\n\n[Use it](http://www.google.com/mobile/sync/).  Simple as that.  Long ago, I remember having to sync things manually, or update something on one computer to reflect the same state as another.  It's kind of ridiculous when all you want is the information.  Whether you use an iPhone, iPad, Android or whatever, this is seriously convenient.\n\n### Calendar\n\nGoogle Calendar is linked right in and used for everything.  Whether I access it on iCal, my iPhone or a browser, it always has the same information.  My wife's a nurse with a rotating schedule, so I import her calendar here as well and always know what her schedule looks like.  I've got friend's and work calendars linked here too.  And because I sync, it shows up wherever, on my phone or computer.\n\n### Contacts\n\nIf you've got email, you've got contacts.  These can sync to your phone and everything else too.  \n\n### Chat\n\nIt's on the right side.  I talk with people on it all the time, so I turned off saving Chat History.  It syncs up with most chat clients like iChat or Adium if you want to use it natively.\n\n### Reader\n\nGoogle Reader is the home of all my subscriptions to blogs or news feeds.  NetNewsWire syncs with it.  Pretty slick.\n\n![NetNewsWire](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhyrr/mhyrr.github.com/master/images/netnewswire.jpg)  \n\n\n### Google Voice\n\nLike everything else, your Google Voice account syncs right up with GMail.  So you can send/receive SMS messages and voicemails right from your email.  \n\n![Text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhyrr/mhyrr.github.com/master/images/txting.jpg)  \n\n\n### Other useful things\n\nOn the bottom right of every page is a link to look at your account activity, including how many sessions are active and where they are geographically.\n\n![Where?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhyrr/mhyrr.github.com/master/images/gmailactivity.jpg)  \n\n\nHit Shift-? for keyboard shortcuts.  If you dislike the mouse, like me, these help.\n\n![g-i is for inbox](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhyrr/mhyrr.github.com/master/images/gmailshortcuts.jpg)  \n\n\n### Amazing and Stunning Conclusion\n\nThat's all I got.  Hopefully it's useful, it is for me.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","html":"<p>Even in 2011, email is the most ubiquitous of internet communications.  Everyone uses it.

It can bring tremendous joy or pain.  It can set wild expectations, deliver an emotional punch, and make us feel better or worse about ourselves than we ought to.\n\nAs I get older, I've found myself thinking and learning more about money.  I used to not care for it or about it at all.  [Erasmus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desiderius_Erasmus), I thought, had it right:\n\n> When I get a little money I buy books, \n> and if any is left over, I buy food and clothes.\n\nMore recently I've started to try to learn more about the concepts of money and economics, which can be deep and complex.  This has been mostly abstract and historical; a subject outside of the practical.  Now though, I'm married and have a baby on the way, and we want to buy a house.  The idea of money is far more practical than it has ever been.\n\nBeing so personal right now, I've been inclined to think things out, which of course means writing.  So what follows is a series of articles about money.  There's nothing new or original here, it's simply a very high-level amalgam of what I've learned.  And there's no better place to start than with some definitions.\n\n## What Money Is\n\nMoney is actually an incredibly simple concept.  It's a medium to exchange goods and services.  That's it.  \n\nLong ago, two parties might have exchanged 4 hens for 2 goats and considered it a fair transaction.  Once trade became prevalent enough, they broke this up into two transactions.  To do this, they used a third commodity, say copper or silver, as an agreed upon standard and set a price.  The hens had a set price and the goats had a set price, and if you wanted either you paid the set price.\n\nThe benefit of this was huge.  With a direct trade, the fairness considered by both parties only reached as far as the one direct trade.  But once you set a price, it's agreed upon by everyone.  So if you want cows instead of goats, you don't have to renegotiate.. you just pay the set price.\n\nThis is actually a fairly fascinating economic concept.  The fact that whole societies can universally accept a single standard of trade is phenomenal.  Even thieves accept money as a fair standard, and use it prevalently.\n\n## Types of Money\n\nThere are actually several types of money, and the differences shouldn't be taken for granted.  \n\nThe original form of money was [commodity money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_money).  The fair standard of trade was some agreed upon commodity, whether gold or silver or bags of wheat.  This is only barely removed from barter.\n\nBags of wheat and gold bullion are hard to transport and easy to steal.  So [representative money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_money) was born right along with banks.  Representative money \"represents\" some amount of an underlying commodity.  For example, an early bank might have written a note that was redeemable by the bearer for one pound of silver.  Instead of having to transfer the silver, the bearer could travel to another bank and safely redeem the silver, or use the note to pay for some goods or service.  Banks were invented to hold these forms of money.\n\nThe United States had representative money up until 1971.  All dollars could be exchanged to the government for silver or gold.  After 1971, dollars became backed by \"the full faith and credit of the United States government\" and became [fiat money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money).  Fiat money has no backing by any commodity.  It has no direct relationship to the price of gold, silver or anything else.  It is mandated by law to be legal tender and its value is only as good as the trust of the entire population that the entire population uses it.\n\nThere are some really wild examples of fiat money.  One of the craziest is the [Rai stones of Yap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yap).  Rai stones are 12 feet wide rings scattered about the islands and used to negotiate land and wedding contracts.  But the stones never move from where they are, they just sit and ownership passes from one party to another.  Some stones are even sitting on the seafloor where they fell off the canoes that transported them!  They're still used as money though.\n\n## Fractional Reserves\n\nFiat money has a lot of implications for the [Federal Reserve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System).  The Fed is not a government agency.  But it operates to print money on behalf of the US Government and controls the entire flow of new US currency.  The direct reason money is cheap right now has its root in the amount of money the Fed has been printing.  The money supply is large and so interest rates are low.  When the supply of money is restricted and more scarce, the cost of borrowing is higher and interest rates go up.\n\nAnother implication is the [fractional-reserve banking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_reserve_banking) system we have now with our fiat money.  Back when banks held representational money, if a bearer came to you with a bank note for a pound of silver and you didn't have it, bad things would happen.  Today, there is no commodity sitting underneath our money and all banks operate under the idea of fractional reserves.  This means they only hold in reserve a small fraction of all the deposits on their books.  The rest they lend out to make more money.  When you deposit money in your bank, they immediately lend it out to make money for themselves (far more than the small interest you get on your savings account).  You have a positive balance and can withdraw money at any time, and the only reason this works is because not everyone wants to withdraw their money at the same time.  If they all do try to withdraw money - say because the public perception of the bank is rocky - then you have a [bank run](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_run).  There are lots of laws to protect against this, especially the [FDIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FDIC) which guarantees your deposit with, you guessed it, the full faith and credit of the United States government.\n\nThe entire fractional-reserve system is pretty complicated and operates based on the [money multiplier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_multiplier) principle.  The central bank (the Fed in the US) loans money to commercial banks based on certain ratios.  The commercial banks then *create* money to loan out based on their reserve ratios according to the equations deemed prudent by the money multiplier principle.  They hold a certain amount of deposits as reserves and loan the rest out to make a profit.  So if you have $2,000 in a savings account in the bank, they may only have $100 of it in reserves.\n\nSince 2008 the entire world has been deleveraging - reducing the debt on their books - including (or especially) commercial banks.  Before 2008, the banks operated pretty close to the maximum ratio of debt to reserves allowed.  Since then, they've been maintaining excess assets.  This is why people say that \"credit has dried up\".  It's much more difficult to get a loan because banks have backed off on their debt/asset ratios.\n\n## Debt and Interest\n\nWhich brings us to the relatively simple concepts of debt and interest.  Back in ancient history when a bank was literally a goldsmith willing to store an amount of gold for a period of time, a bank note for the gold was a form of debt.  The goldsmith agreed that the bearer of the note could receive the proper amount of gold sometime in the future.  Today, the exact opposite is far more frequent.  A bank takes its deposits, according to the money multiplier principle, and distributes them to customers looking for a loan.  The person accepting the loan agrees to pay the debt back, along with an interest charge.  The interest is simply the profit on the transaction, based on the cost and risk to the bank.\n\nBonds and loans are really no different.  When you take a loan out for a car, you're agreeing to pay the bank back the debt plus the interest agreed upon in the contract.  This is calculated with an amortization table, which is just a fancy way of stating the calculation of the debt and interest payments over time.  When you take out a bond, you're actually giving someone else a loan and they're agreeing to pay you back.  The only difference is that in both cases, the other party is the one setting the interest rate, which is the profit that either they or you make from the transaction.\n\n[Credit cards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card) are just another form of debt.  Where a car loan might hold the value of the car as collateral against the risk that the loan isn't paid, a credit card has no asset to back it up.  A credit card is really an agreement against the \"full faith and credit of YOU\" to pay it off, just like the government guarantees all our money with their full faith and credit.  Keep this in mind when you use your credit card, your reputation is on the line.\n","html":"<p>Money is a funny thing.  It can bring tremendous joy or pain.

I said all of that to say this:\n\n**Money is just a tool.  Nothing more, nothing less.**\n\nThe reason that everyone seems to care about money is because they actually care about something else: wealth.  \n\nWealth can have a lot of different meanings.  What it seems to represent is having enough stuff; enough material possessions.  But wealth can also be represented by health, by knowledge, by time, by good work, by friends and family, and by contentment.  Most people work at acquiring wealth as a means of striving for a good life.  Unfortunately, this devolves into acquiring stuff.  Which eventually devolves into desiring money.\n\n## Relative and Absolute\n\nThe draw towards more wealth is a perfectly normal human activity.  It's healthy and positive.  A wealthy society will be more peaceful, more healthy, and more happy.  More wealth is something we absolutely should strive for all the time.\n\nThings get mucked up when people don't understand the difference between relative and absolute wealth.  Relative wealth is the result of a comparison.  Do I have more or less than that other guy?\n\n**More** is a good thing.  **More than everyone else** is selfish and stupid.  Never has there been a more foolish game than keeping up with the Joneses.  \n\nWith the Joneses, it doesn't matter how much you have as long as you have more than them.  You could have no more than a shopping cart full of crap, but as long as you have more in your shopping cart than that other guy, it's fine.  \n\nThe Joneses game never stops along the economic ladder either, from the poorest of the poor to the very richest.  Most people think about it in the context of the middle class, but that's simply because most of us are *in* the middle class.  Rich Karlgaard published a [great editorial in Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/global/2011/1010/opinions-innovation-rules-wealth-america-rich-karlgaard.html) that shows just how shallow and fickle this game can be.  He goes to the very top of the economic food chain and shows just how ridiculous it is to compare yourself to others.\n\nHave you ever noticed that the poor live a sort of tawdry caricature of wealthy people?  The time is long past when the wealthy owned the land and the poor worked it or herded goats.  Now the poor and wealthy often wear very similar clothes or have the same phone.  But because the poor are constantly looking upwards and comparing - and our culture compels them to do so - they have cheap and ugly versions of the nice things that the wealthy own.\n\n[Paul Graham noted in a podcast](http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2009/08/graham_on_start.html) that artists short-circuit the Joneses comparison.  A thousand years ago, if you were poor, you probably lived in filth and squalor.  As our entire society has gotten richer, being poor has been entirely separated from living squalidly.  The poor artist is the champion of this separation.  Instead of trying to live the caricatured life of the rich, they grab an industrial space, paint it white so it's cheap and cheery, and live and work happily.  If they don't need to try to keep up, they can live happily with a reasonable level of absolute wealth.  Because it's so cheap today to live this way, they don't need a ridiculous job to barely support their lifestyle and they have an abundance of time.\n\n## Time and Money\n\nTime is what the artist really gets right.  Time is the most undervalued commodity we have.  One of the things that's so much easier when you have money is that you're not restricted to perform tasks you don't want to perform.  You can pay someone else to cut the grass, to install the fan, to clean your house.  This frees your time up for either more enjoyable or more profitable things.  \n\nConsider that you're a lawyer and your hourly rate is $300.  You **could** stay home and clean the house for a couple of hours a week.  But unless your cleaning service is exorbitantly expensive, it's in your own financial interest to work a bit more and pay someone else.  And if you don't want to work more, you don't need to work very long to pay for the cleaning anyway.\n\nYour choice of trade-offs in this area can, in a strict sense, totally buy happiness.  When you look at the time/money tradeoff, it's much easier to reserve judgment about what choices people make than it is when you're thinking simply about spending money.  The focus is choices, and because everyone has different sensibilities about what's important, everyone's choices will be different.\n\n## A Hypothetical Utopia\n\nAs a thought experiment about wealth, let's consider an alternate world.  This world is exactly the same as the one we live in.. except for one difference.  Every single person gets a base $100,000 per year.  If they work, they can make more but they don't have to.  If they spend it all they can't ask for more.\n\nHow would our thinking change in this world?  A large segment of the population would probably just do nothing.  Some might squander the money, but it's hard to not at least make it through a year on $100,000, especially if you have a family getting a couple of those payments.  You could do absolutely nothing except watch Ricki Lake and American Idol every day and be-- well you wouldn't be fine, but you would still have money to pay for rent and food.  \n\nThe rich who owned land, property, or companies could still be vastly more wealthy than the poor.  But.. would the poor be poor?  Would the base folks who have \"only\" $100,000/year be begging for the millions some small minority has?\n\nProbably.  Most people think of wealth as the Joneses they need to keep up with.  It's not about how much time and money you have, it's about comparisons.\n\nAnd that just plain sucks.  In some sense at least, we're heading towards this alternate world.  Paul Graham [points out](http://www.paulgraham.com/stuff.html) that \"hardly anyone is so poor that they can't afford a front yard full of old cars.\"  It seems like nobody is too poor to own a cell phone either, a rather impressive piece of technology.  \n\n## Resources\n\nThis wasn't always the case.  Three hundred years ago the poor were *really* poor.  A thousand years ago was worse.  Maybe they lived in a tiny one room house and subsistence farmed a small piece of land.  Or they lived off a city street that reeked of the feces they threw out the window each day.  And even the rich back then were poor by today's standards.  They had no car, no washer/dryer, no phone, very few clothes, no electricity, no running hot water.\n\nTechnology is what has been driving wealth.  Wealth used to be huge pieces of land and many goats.  Neither the lord of the land nor the vassal had particularly good health or knowledge.  The lord simply had land, and there's only a limited amount of that resource.\n\nHealth, knowledge, and contentment on the other hand are virtually limitless.  Medicine and books today are becoming ubiquitous.  Cell phones and tablets are on their way.  Imagine when *everyone* has internet access and vaccines.  Technology is driving us towards that world.\n\nOne interesting part of this trend is that we humans have learned how to manage our physical world in a far more efficient manner than we used to.  As farmers, the best we could do to manage our physical resources was till the land and make plants grow.  As smiths and metalworkers, we were able to process more difficult raw materials and make better tools.\n\nAnd today?  Today we can mass-produce a dazzling array of knowledge tools capable of holding or accessing almost all of human knowledge and progress from anywhere in the world.  Computers are the zenith of our technical progress so far.  In the same way that the brain is the most complex and fascinating thing we know in the universe, so to is the computer the most complex and fascinating thing of our own making.  Transistors and magnetic storage approach the atomic level of organization and are mass-produced cheaply enough for huge segments of the population.  \n\nThis is a *big* change.  In a few hundred years, we've moved from managing our physical resources on the level of acres of land to managing resources on the level of molecules and atoms today.  How exciting will the next hundred years of progress and improvement be?  \n\nAnd the further our progress takes us, the more ridiculous our need for comparisons will be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","html":"<p>In the intro to this little series on money, I laid out a bunch of very simple concepts about what money is and how it works in our system.

Some might squander the money, but it's hard to not at least make it through a year on $100,000, especially if you have a family getting a couple of those payments.  You could do absolutely nothing except watch Ricki Lake and American Idol every day and be-- well you wouldn't be fine, but you would still have money to pay for rent and food.  </p>\n\n<p>The rich who owned land, property, or companies could still be vastly more wealthy than the poor.  But.. would the poor be poor?  Would the base folks who have \"only\" $100,000/year be begging for the millions some small minority has?</p>\n\n<p>Probably.  Most people think of wealth as the Joneses they need to keep up with.  It's not about how much time and money you have, it's about comparisons.</p>\n\n<p>And that just plain sucks.  In some sense at least, we're heading towards this alternate world.  Paul Graham <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/stuff.html\">points out</a> that \"hardly anyone is so poor that they can't afford a front yard full of old cars.\"  It seems like nobody is too poor to own a cell phone either, a rather impressive piece of technology.  </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"resources\">Resources</h2>\n\n<p>This wasn't always the case.  Three hundred years ago the poor were <em>really</em> poor.  A thousand years ago was worse.  Maybe they lived in a tiny one room house and subsistence farmed a small piece of land.  Or they lived off a city street that reeked of the feces they threw out the window each day.  And even the rich back then were poor by today's standards.  They had no car, no washer/dryer, no phone, very few clothes, no electricity, no running hot water.</p>\n\n<p>Technology is what has been driving wealth.  Wealth used to be huge pieces of land and many goats.  Neither the lord of the land nor the vassal had particularly good health or knowledge.  The lord simply had land, and there's only a limited amount of that resource.</p>\n\n<p>Health, knowledge, and contentment on the other hand are virtually limitless.  Medicine and books today are becoming ubiquitous.  Cell phones and tablets are on their way.  Imagine when <em>everyone</em> has internet access and vaccines.  Technology is driving us towards that world.</p>\n\n<p>One interesting part of this trend is that we humans have learned how to manage our physical world in a far more efficient manner than we used to.  As farmers, the best we could do to manage our physical resources was till the land and make plants grow.  As smiths and metalworkers, we were able to process more difficult raw materials and make better tools.</p>\n\n<p>And today?  Today we can mass-produce a dazzling array of knowledge tools capable of holding or accessing almost all of human knowledge and progress from anywhere in the world.  Computers are the zenith of our technical progress so far.  In the same way that the brain is the most complex and fascinating thing we know in the universe, so to is the computer the most complex and fascinating thing of our own making.  Transistors and magnetic storage approach the atomic level of organization and are mass-produced cheaply enough for huge segments of the population.  </p>\n\n<p>This is a <em>big</em> change.  In a few hundred years, we've moved from managing our physical resources on the level of acres of land to managing resources on the level of molecules and atoms today.  How exciting will the next hundred years of progress and improvement be?  </p>\n\n<p>And the further our progress takes us, the more ridiculous our need for comparisons will be.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"de_DE","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2011-11-21T05:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2011-11-21T05:00:00.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2011-11-21T05:00:00.000Z","published_by":1,"visibility":"public","mobiledoc":null,"amp":null},{"id":69,"uuid":"357a8ad4-08ea-4057-883d-689420d53e7a","title":"Money - Income, Expenses, and Value","slug":"practical","markdown":"This is where we get into the meat and potatoes.  This is where things get more fun.  Since money is a tool, how and why should I use it?\n\n## Maslow\n\nTo understand motivations, take a brief look at [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs).  It's an old, well-used model, but it still has relevance to how we should organize and structure our lives.\n\n![Maslow](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Maslow%27s_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg/640px-Maslow%27s_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg.png)\n\nMaslow's pyramid tries to characterize what is important for a person to be a person.  The bottom of the pyramid are all things we largely take for granted now: food, clean water, sanitation, sleep.  The pyramid builds on every step, but each is required for our happiness.  When Maslow described the last step, self-actualization, he said, “What a man can be, he must be.”  Nothing is more important than that.  At the very least, money shouldn't get in the way.  Maybe sometimes it can help too.\n\n## Minimize and Maximize\n\nSo the purpose of acquiring wealth is to use it for a range of needs from basic sustenance to Maslow's self-actualization.  On a practical, everyday level, there are two ways to do this: minimize your expenses and maximize your income.\n\n### Expenses\n\nPeople are generally oblivious of what they spend their money on.  I know I was for the longest time.  I had a set of credit cards and when I wanted something, I put it on a card.  When the bills came, I did my best to pay some reasonable percentage of the bill, and told myself I'd do better next month.  This is what most people do.\n\nMost of my friends still think money flows out of me like water, because I never seemed to care that much.  I just bought stuff.  Those days are long gone now.  I still spend money when it's on something I feel is important, but I'm in a far better position now because I know exactly what I spend money on and I know why it's important.\n\n*The number one thing you can do to manage your expenses is get better measurements of your expenses.*  You have to be able to measure something to effect a change.  Fortunately, the tools available for this have gotten vastly better in a small amount of time.  Gone is the day of the paper ledger, and even the spreadsheet (although if you use and are comfortable with a budgeting system on a spreadsheet, go for it).  Most banks have good internal tools.  My favorite is [Mint](https://www.mint.com), a free service that has a read-only view into your online accounts and provides great tools to determine your financial health and habits.  I'm keeping a sharp eye on [Simple](https://www.simple.com/) as well.\n\nOnce you know what you spend, you can start asking real questions about what you really need.  Maslow's hierarchy is perfect for this.  My goal for the basic needs now - food, clothing and housing - is to minimize it monthly based on a reasonable quality of life that allows me to continue my goals of self-actualization.  In other words, the basics can be had for pretty cheap.  But instead of seeking the cheapest possible solution, I want to find the cheapest solution that still lets me **drive towards being who I am**.  \n\nThe artist I mentioned in the last article is the master of this.  They meet their basic requirements in such a fashion as to focus on what's important to them: working on their abilities as an artist.\n\nNote how different this is from driving to keep up with the Joneses.  In comparing to others, you and your family aren't even a factor in the equation.  The only factor is putting up a sufficiently pretty facade to meet the vision of some quasi-real group of people.  People continually get sucked into having a more expensive car or house when what they have now suits their needs perfectly.  Instead of putting their time and money towards a drawing class maybe they've always wanted to take, they drive towards a larger monthly mortgage payment and more hours at the office because they think they need a McMansion to live right.  \n\nWhen you focus on your own needs and with money as a tool in your toolbelt, the drive towards happiness becomes possible.\n\n#### Branding\n\nOf course, the entire world is arrayed against you.  Here's an open secret: the consumer companies of the world are intent on keeping you relatively unwealthy by getting you to give them money for things they make you think you need.\n\nBrand is the method by which they do this.  Long ago, brand was a sign of quality based on a reputation.  Today, a lot of it is nonsense.  This is because of another, less open secret: the manufacturing and technological capabilities of the world today are so good that the relative differences between brands are based on style and exclusivity, not on quality.\n\n[I talked about this before](http://www.infiniteabyss.org/2011/10/17/ferrari.html) with regard to cars.  Cars are a very poignant example for me because I've done such a bad job with buying cars in the past.  It's not that I've ever taken a very huge loss on a deal or defaulted on a loan, I've just been fickle about purchases.  I've had 20 cars and I'm only 31.  I've always assumed a car payment.\n\nFinally now, I'm on the way to changing that.  I've got a sturdy, comfortable, reliable Nissan SUV I bought used that satisfies all of my needs.  We're working towards having no car payments.  Racing - the reason I've had so many cars - used to be a point of contention between my wife and I.  That has basically ceased ever since we did a very simple thing: we set a budget for it.\n\nSo despite what brand and marketing tells me, the differences between a Honda or Nissan and a BMW or Mercedes are far less discernible, especially compared to my needs for a car.  My Nissan has heated seats, a heated steering wheel, A/C, sunroof, a great stereo, iPod hookup, DVD player, great brakes, and great towing capacity.  What does a Mercedes have that I need?  Seat massagers?  [Distronic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_cruise_control_system)?  I don't think so.  A Nissan will have all of that in ten years anyway.\n\n#### But I'll Still Buy Luxury Brands\n\nBrand for cars is equivalent to a sign of the future.  It serves a different purpose for other consumer products.  The CEO of McDonald's once said that they are in the real estate business rather than the food service business.  Similarly, Louis Vuitton has LV draped over all their products.  Why?  Because when you see LV on a brown purse, you know it cost the idiot carrying it $1600.  Louis Vuitton isn't about fine linens and purses, it's about a name; they're in the celebrity business.  Brand in fashion is signaling on income.  Old Navy signals stylish mainstream.  Levi's Jeans signal tough and durable.  Louis Vuitton signals money.  Fuck that.  For a very small, very wealthy segment of the population, buying a $1600 purse is like you or I buying a pack of gum.  Let them keep their purses.\n\n![LV Purses](http://cdn.purseblog.com/images/louis-vuitton-monogran-canvas-bags.jpg)\n\nThat said, luxury brands still have a place in our world and it's important to understand what that place is.  Most people have an expectation that when they buy a $100 bottle of wine, it will be 10x better than their normal $10 bottle.  A $1000 bottle would be 100x better.  Unfortunately, quality doesn't scale so linearly.  It's been [shown in studies](http://wine-economics.org/workingpapers/AAWE_WP03.pdf) that price itself is one of the number one signals that a consumer uses to rate wine.  On price alone, the average consumer will think a $30 bottle better than a $10 bottle.\n\nIt might **be** better, but only a connoisseur might notice.  More importantly, luxury products like this move towards some undefinable point of perfection on a log scale.  A $100 bottle is 99.9% of perfect rather than 99%.  If the approach of that perfection is important to you, maybe the price tag is worth it.  If you understand it.\n\n![Value](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhyrr/mhyrr.github.com/master/images/value.png)\n\nComputers and jeans are my own examples.  I've spent quite a bit more than I need to on computers.  But I'm on them so much, everyday, that the value of a $1500 Macbook Pro over a $250 Acer is paid for a thousand times over.  Extra software and data backups are a no-brainer too.  As technology gets better and better, these things become closer to commodities.  The hardware of my iPhone is just a commodity tool for data and communication now.\n\nIt's a similar story with jeans.  I've tried a ton of brands and I've hated every pair.  They're uncomfortable, scratchy, fall apart and look silly to me.  Then I stumbled on Ermenegildo Zegna, an Italian luxury clothing manufacturer.  They're the only jeans I wear now.  I have 3 pairs at $200/pop, but I wear them constantly, they're incredibly comfortable, they have more longevity, and they actually look good.  The value proposition they offer me are worth their price.\n\n#### Value\n\nValue is the underlying principle of importance when looking at acquiring material goods.  Will the value of this \"thing\" reflect it's price for me?  Price is specified by the seller.  Value is discerned by the buyer.  The value might be reflected by time saved, peace of mind, or the happiness of your children.  Being able to discern this on your own, without the influence of the Joneses around, is a profoundly freeing process.\n\nNotice I said \"discern\" rather than \"decide\".  There's a subtle difference.  Discerning is the act of recognizing something.  Deciding is a choice you make.  The reason that finding value is a discernment rather than a decision is that it's based on your own Hierarchy of Needs.  Deciding on something can be fleeting and fickle.  Discernment is a search for the truth of something.  Deciding is looking at some \"thing\" and saying \"I want this.\"  Discerning is looking at some \"thing\" and saying \"How will this help me and my family towards our goals?\"\n\n### Income\n\nIncome is the flipside of expenses.  There are three basic ways to make income:\n\n* Trade your time for money directly by means of some skill\n* Trade the time of a set of people for money by means of some skill \n* Provide a product with a value proposition people are willing to pay for\n\nTrading time for money directly is what most people do.  They have some set of skills that their employer pays them for based on a set amount of time per year.  In the US today that's roughly 1900-2000 hours.  In France it's less hours.  In Japan it's more.\n\nThis direct trade has a natural limit, and doctors and lawyers hit it (and engineers are driving towards it too).  These types of jobs are full of esteem and establishment because their required skills demand a very high pay for a given amount of time.  Deservedly.  \n\nUnfortunately, trading money for time directly is about the most inefficient way of acquiring income.  To get any more than a doctor or a lawyer requires something new, something different than trading time for money.\n\nThe next option is to trade the time of a bunch of people for money.  It's easy to see how the owner of a plumbing company with 250 plumbers working for him can make far more than a doctor.  The employees are paid for their time directly and the owner gets a cut of each for the overhead and drive to manage the business itself.\n\nThe last choice is to provide some sort of product that people are willing to pay for.  Car manufacturing, Panera Bread, writers, Walmart, real estate investments, and Google are all examples of this.  They are successful or not based on the value they provide, the resources necessary to meet demand, and the ability of the value proposition they offer to scale to a large audience.  Google, for instance, provides extremely valuable services (information search), has very low overhead, and can scale out to literally the entire world.  That's why they're so successful and profitable.\n\nRuss Roberts of Econtalk described this with an analogy on Gilligan's Island.  If the Professor spends a bunch of time inventing some time-saving device that he can sell for $1, he'll have a problem.  There's only 7 people on the island, so his potential income is only $7 and he won't even bother to build such a device.  If, on the other hand, he can get off the island his potential customer base is 7 billion people, and his potential profit is thus $7 billion.  When you can scale a product to a large audience, you can drive a lot of value to a lot of people.\n\nThis is why it always seems ridiculous when you break out Lebron James' salary on a per game basis.  If you did that he'd make way over $100,000 per game.  It doesn't make any sense for a very good reason.  He's not paid per game.  He's paid for his value to the corporation that hires him.  That value is based not only on his basketball skills, but also his celebrity and branding opportunity.  How many people wanted a Cavaliers jersey before he showed up in Cleveland?  How many people in Miami wear a [Mario Chalmers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat#Current_roster) jersey now?\n\nI ordered these three options for a purpose.  The further abstracted your income is from your time, the more secure it is.  Disability insurance is needed for salaried employees because without trading their time for money directly, they have no income.  A real estate owner or investor doesn't need that.  Neither does someone with passive income off stocks.  Similarly, your time is more free to do what you want with it.  You don't have to keep working all the time to keep income.  Rarely does a salaried worker take a 4 month vacation, but investors, business owners, or anyone with a passive income source has more of those opportunities.\n\n## Focus\n\nWhen push comes to shove, which is more important, minimizing expenses or maximizing income?  In the short term, it's certainly easier to draw down expenses.  Unfortunately this can only go so far.  You can't get to zero, and the more you cut out the harder it is to shave even more.\n\nThere's also always the question of wealth in the form of quality of life, time, health, work, family and happiness.  For instance, there can be a huge time commitment involved in cutting bills.  The Extreme Couponers on TLC are the edge case.  Some of those people spend hours and hours a week to shave their grocery bills down close to zero.  It's almost another full time job.  What would happen if they focused that energy on building income instead?\n\nIncome is, in a strict sense, limitless.  Bill Gates certainly doesn't worry if his food budget is $1000 or $5000 per month.  In the longer term, life gets easier when you can expand your income so that your bills just don't matter that much.\n\n### Subsistence\n\nThe worst thing to do is float along with a net zero budget regardless of income.  I call this Subsistence Budgeting.  Just as subsistence farming is farming only barely enough food to survive, so subsistence budgeting is budgeting with the simple goal of ensuring that your income and expenses net to zero each month.  You can make $25,000 or $500,000 a year and still be simply subsisting.  It's a setup for failure, usually but not always driven by the Joneses.  Subsistence budgeting means that as soon as your income is turned off, you're screwed.  Your expenses are so high that you have no buffer.  Especially when you work for a salary at a company, the on/off income switch is completely outside of your control, whether you feel comfortable or not.\n\n","html":"<p>This is where we get into the meat and potatoes.

There are three basic ways to make income:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Trade your time for money directly by means of some skill</li>\n<li>Trade the time of a set of people for money by means of some skill </li>\n<li>Provide a product with a value proposition people are willing to pay for</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Trading time for money directly is what most people do.  They have some set of skills that their employer pays them for based on a set amount of time per year.  In the US today that's roughly 1900-2000 hours.  In France it's less hours.  In Japan it's more.</p>\n\n<p>This direct trade has a natural limit, and doctors and lawyers hit it (and engineers are driving towards it too).  These types of jobs are full of esteem and establishment because their required skills demand a very high pay for a given amount of time.  Deservedly.  </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, trading money for time directly is about the most inefficient way of acquiring income.  To get any more than a doctor or a lawyer requires something new, something different than trading time for money.</p>\n\n<p>The next option is to trade the time of a bunch of people for money.  It's easy to see how the owner of a plumbing company with 250 plumbers working for him can make far more than a doctor.  The employees are paid for their time directly and the owner gets a cut of each for the overhead and drive to manage the business itself.</p>\n\n<p>The last choice is to provide some sort of product that people are willing to pay for.  Car manufacturing, Panera Bread, writers, Walmart, real estate investments, and Google are all examples of this.  They are successful or not based on the value they provide, the resources necessary to meet demand, and the ability of the value proposition they offer to scale to a large audience.  Google, for instance, provides extremely valuable services (information search), has very low overhead, and can scale out to literally the entire world.  That's why they're so successful and profitable.</p>\n\n<p>Russ Roberts of Econtalk described this with an analogy on Gilligan's Island.  If the Professor spends a bunch of time inventing some time-saving device that he can sell for $1, he'll have a problem.  There's only 7 people on the island, so his potential income is only $7 and he won't even bother to build such a device.  If, on the other hand, he can get off the island his potential customer base is 7 billion people, and his potential profit is thus $7 billion.  When you can scale a product to a large audience, you can drive a lot of value to a lot of people.</p>\n\n<p>This is why it always seems ridiculous when you break out Lebron James' salary on a per game basis.  If you did that he'd make way over $100,000 per game.  It doesn't make any sense for a very good reason.  He's not paid per game.  He's paid for his value to the corporation that hires him.  That value is based not only on his basketball skills, but also his celebrity and branding opportunity.  How many people wanted a Cavaliers jersey before he showed up in Cleveland?  How many people in Miami wear a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat#Current_roster\">Mario Chalmers</a> jersey now?</p>\n\n<p>I ordered these three options for a purpose.  The further abstracted your income is from your time, the more secure it is.  Disability insurance is needed for salaried employees because without trading their time for money directly, they have no income.  A real estate owner or investor doesn't need that.  Neither does someone with passive income off stocks.  Similarly, your time is more free to do what you want with it.  You don't have to keep working all the time to keep income.  Rarely does a salaried worker take a 4 month vacation, but investors, business owners, or anyone with a passive income source has more of those opportunities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"focus\">Focus</h2>\n\n<p>When push comes to shove, which is more important, minimizing expenses or maximizing income?  In the short term, it's certainly easier to draw down expenses.  Unfortunately this can only go so far.  You can't get to zero, and the more you cut out the harder it is to shave even more.</p>\n\n<p>There's also always the question of wealth in the form of quality of life, time, health, work, family and happiness.  For instance, there can be a huge time commitment involved in cutting bills.  The Extreme Couponers on TLC are the edge case.  Some of those people spend hours and hours a week to shave their grocery bills down close to zero.  It's almost another full time job.  What would happen if they focused that energy on building income instead?</p>\n\n<p>Income is, in a strict sense, limitless.  Bill Gates certainly doesn't worry if his food budget is $1000 or $5000 per month.  In the longer term, life gets easier when you can expand your income so that your bills just don't matter that much.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"subsistence\">Subsistence</h3>\n\n<p>The worst thing to do is float along with a net zero budget regardless of income.  I call this Subsistence Budgeting.  Just as subsistence farming is farming only barely enough food to survive, so subsistence budgeting is budgeting with the simple goal of ensuring that your income and expenses net to zero each month.  You can make $25,000 or $500,000 a year and still be simply subsisting.  It's a setup for failure, usually but not always driven by the Joneses.  Subsistence budgeting means that as soon as your income is turned off, you're screwed.  Your expenses are so high that you have no buffer.  Especially when you work for a salary at a company, the on/off income switch is completely outside of your control, whether you feel comfortable or not.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"de_DE","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2011-11-22T05:00:00.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2017-04-04T01:58:43.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2011-11-22T05:00:00.000Z","published_by":1,"visibility":"public","mobiledoc":null,"amp":null},{"id":70,"uuid":"8effc566-db4a-4c80-a2df-b4a8af9fc619","title":"Money - Psychology","slug":"psychology","markdown":"## Psychology\n\nSome of the ideas I've presented so far are certainly different than how most people think about money, but they're not original.\n\nThe most important thing about this entire topic is psychology.  The trouble that most people have with money is not simple math, it's how they think about it.  Most people - and that certainly includes me - struggle constantly with comparisons and material desires.  This is why the identification of wealth as something not exclusively material is so important.  Representing wealth as time, health, work, or happiness presents an altogether different, more humble, more realistic, and *more joyful* perspective on money.\n\n### Dave Ramsey\n\nI read [Dave Ramsey's book](http://www.amazon.com/Total-Money-Makeover-Financial-Fitness/dp/159555078X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1321824870&sr=8-1) a little while back with the expressed intent of understanding exactly what I didn't like about his methods.  I knew I didn't like it, but I wanted to be able to speak more cogently about why.\n\nIt turns out that I agree with most of what he says.  Ramsey starts with psychology and changing the way people think about money.  The [Debt Snowball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-snowball_method) method is the most obvious example.  Paying off the smallest debt regardless of interest costs is mathematically incorrect, but it ties directly into transforming the psychology of the debtor.  The math doesn't matter anyway.. extreme circumstances excepting, if you were that good at math, you wouldn't be in huge debt in the first place!\n\nDave's process is generally laudable and he wants badly to help people in bad situations.  Starting with changing psychology is the right way to do it, so kudos to him.  Still, I worry that he relies too much on the idea of discipline and material wealth.  The people he uses as examples in his books all turned things around with massive discipline and all push towards having strong material wealth.\n\nSo I want to be very specific about the differences between what I'm trying to say and what Dave Ramsey says.  His method is a way to change psychology to drive discipline and build wealth.  He focuses on contentment and charity as well, and I'm all for it.  The point of difference to me is the definition of wealth.  By asking the question of our own goals in the form of time, health, work, and happiness, we get to completely sidestep the question of discipline.  The answer to \"Why don't I want to buy that right now?\" changes from \"it's not in the budget\" or \"disciplined spending habits\" to \"that's not a part of my goals.\"  That change, for me at least, is an altogether more powerful force.  But then I've never had much discipline on spending, or anything else.\n\nNo-debt-at-all is another thing I don't agree with in Dave Ramsey's worldview.  He seems to be against it in any form and insists on paying it off immediately.  Instead, I think debt is just another tool.  When interest rates are low (money is cheap), it's reasonable to consider using debt as a tool for wealth.  As a rule, if you can't pay it off right now, then don't use debt.  When you're just starting out this doesn't make sense for something like a car, but spreading a mid-size cost out over two or three months on a credit card isn't unreasonable.  Especially if it's something important like a new lens for your photography hobby.  On the corporate side this is called [leverage](http://blog.investy.com/why-use-credit-when-you-have-cash).  Companies use debt as a tool even when they have lots of cash in the bank.  \n\nUnderstanding the goals towards which you strive is the most important thing.\n\n## Retirement\n\nRetirement is the other huge piece of psychology that is an affront to the idea of wealth.\n\nSome people actually like to make things.  For these people, retirement is a misnomer.  Retirement is actually the ability to have control over what they make - to do what they want.  These people work to get enough money to work on whatever they want.\n\nOn the other hand, some people really are just lazy.  They like to waste time.  Perhaps this is a majority, but from them we get the more classical definition of retirement.  You work until you have enough money to do nothing.  These sorts of people look forward to retirement so they can \"stop working\".\n\nWhat a crazy perspective that is!  Never in my life can I remember wanting to specifically \"do nothing\".  And yet this is what it seems the majority of people are working towards, whether they want it or not.  Why?\n\nThe notion of retirement isn't much older than a few generations, but as the population and life expectancy has grown together, we've ended up with a huge percentage of older folks.  For many of our parents or grandparents, the way towards retirement was the pension plan.  Today's version is the 401k.  The current generation thinks if they put money in their 401k or 403b it will be a magical panacea for their future financial concerns.\n\nThis is another reason why the idea of a fixed income is so inefficient.  Fixed income is a tradeoff.  You give me a certain quantum of work for a long period of time and I'll give you the perceived benefit of a time in your life when you can do nothing.  If that's your preferred definition of retirement, then you already have the best of all possible worlds: a stable contract to do relatively little and sit around.\n\nIf it's not clear yet: *We need a new definition of retirement.*  So let's take another stab at it based on the first group of people: the ones who like to make things.  Then retirement is the time and opportunity to do good solid work on whatever you want.  \n\nWhat a big difference!  Did you catch the subtext when Maslow said “What a man can be, he must be\"?  To achieve self-actualization, Man must work!\n\nHopefully that's not scary.  Work is meant to be joyous.  Work is NOT necessarily equivalent to \"a job\".  Consider the notion of work as an integral part of the wealth of your own life rather than simply as a means to acquire money as an intermediary to material wealth.  \n\n*Staggering.*  \n\nIt means retirement doesn't start when you're 65.  It means your job is not a dead-end.  It reaffirms the belief that some of the most joyful people are those who love their work.  Maybe it's even a part of their job, but it doesn't have to be.\n\nThe hardest thing about retirement then is figuring out what the things are that you want to make or do.  Most people don't ever have time to themselves to figure this out.  As a child they're told what to do and where to be.  This continues through high school.  Then they have a small bit of freedom in and right after college.  Then they get a job, they find their spouses, and start a family.  Once again they're told - in a way - what to do and where to be.  Consequently, most people don't actually know what it is they want to do, or even that they ought to be working towards it.  They just think they ought to be working to support their cyclic lifestyle.\n\n![I am free](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/422895344_d8c925ccc0.jpg?v=0)\n\nIf you're between 18 and 30, listen up: right now is your biggest opportunity to break out of this false construct.  Start figuring out what it is you want to do with your life.  Go to Italy or Ireland for 6 months if it will help.  What do you enjoy and what do you feel called to do?  What do you discern in your work?  How does your time, your health, your family, and your joy relate to it?  If you're 40 already or 50, or 60, or 70, don't let that stop you.  There are tons of businesses, schools, and charitable services that would love your time.  There are tons of people that will love your drawings, the books you want to write, or the chairs and tables you'd love to build them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","html":"<h2 id=\"psychology\">Psychology</h2>\n\n<p>Some of the ideas I've presented so far are certainly different than how most people think about money, but they're not original.</p>\n\n<p>The most important thing about this entire topic is psychology.

He didn't figure out relativity because he was paid to do it, he figured it out because it was fun.  It was hard work, but there was joy in it.\n\n* Gold goes up in fiat money markets when there's apprehension.

Speed traps, especially the unmanned stationary kind all over my home county in Maryland, are revenue generating, machine perpetuating products of bureaucracy.  Unfortunately, bureaucracy is perhaps the most regenerating organism ever invented, so there is no way to ever overcome speed traps by conveying such a rational argument.  The only way to actually demolish these outposts of revenue is to declare them as dangerous.  I hope to show that they are, in fact, dangerous.\n\nFirst, I'd like to provide some empirical evidence.  I'm familiar with two types of stationary unmanned speed trap.  There is the set of poles on the side of a county road, usually with a speed limit in the 25-45 mph range, and the portable Jeep (or similar), usually setup along a highway with a construction zone 55 mph limit.  What happens when you see one of these?  You slow down.  Your speed problem has been averted right?  What happens behind you when you slow down and the person doesn't see or know the trap is there?  They have a moment of panic at your seemingly erratic driving behavior and slow down faster.  In other words, speed traps have the tendency to increase the speed deltas across traffic, especially across multiple lanes of traffic.  Some slow down and some do not because of either ignorance or lack of urgency. \n\nNow consider this summary from a publication of the Safety Design Division of the Federal Highway Administration, [published 1998](http://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/speedmgt/ref_mats/fhwasa09028/resources/Synthesis%20of%20Safety%20Researc...pdf):\n\n* That the evidence shows that the risk of having a crash is increased both for vehicles traveling slower than the average speed, and for those traveling above the average speed.\n* That the risk of being injured increases exponentially with speeds much faster than the median speed.\n* That the severity of a crash depends on the vehicle speed change at impact.\n* That there is limited evidence that suggests that lower speed limits result in lower speeds on a system wide basis.\n* That most crashes related to speed involve speed too fast for the conditions.\n* That more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of traffic calming.\n\nI don't know where you live, but where I live the median speed on a 55 mph highway is somewhere around 70 mph.  70 is a *reasonable* speed, regardless of the speed limit.  When people see a speed camera they slow way down, increasing the deltas from average speed.  Note also that the study says most crashes related to speed involve speed too fast for the conditions; this is not correlated to speed limits.\n\nSo crashes occur more often when vehicles have a larger deviation from the average speed, *whether slower or faster*.  Next, let's take a look at a quite [unrelated study on Israeli Daycares](http://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/gneezy/docs/fine.pdf).  You might have heard about this one before, it was mentioned by the Freakonomics guys as a fascinating commentary on incentives, which it is.  The study tracked daycares with a policy to pick up kids by a certain time after school.  The daycares that provided a negative incentive for being late - in this case a fine of $3 - actually had an *increase* in incidence of lateness.  This bizarre result shows the power of incentives, even negative incentives, for defining the social contract.  The authors provide examples with game theory and show how the addition of the fine changes the equilibrium to allow for a new normal.  They also note that \"It is true that a ‘large enough’ fee would eventually reduce the behavior.\"  I know I'd be willing to not worry about being late if it only cost me $3.\n\nAnd I bet we all say the same thing about those speed traps.  I'll slow down usually, but the fine is not scary enough to make me care a lot.  $40 is an inconvenience not a dramatic imposition.  I wish there was data to show this (I don't think it's possible to get it), but I'll bet the incidence rates of speeding in areas where speed traps have been set have actually increased.\n\nFinally, I pulled some data from the DOT's Fatality Analysis Reporting System.  I didn't dive in too deeply, but found some interesting stuff anyway.  Here's the data on Speed Limits vs. Speeding in Fatal Crashes across the US for 2010:\n\n![Speed Limits](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhyrr/mhyrr.github.com/master/images/speedingvspeedlimit.jpg)\n\nThe total number of crashes does not seem to be correlated with increasing speed.  55 mph has a big spike because most miles traveled by car are in 55 mph zones on highways.  If someone could find me data on the number of highway miles per speed limit designation, I'd love to map it to this to see if they are closely correlated (which I think they are).  \n\nSpeeding occurs in about 1 in 4 fatal crashes.  Certainly bad, but not as dramatic as I expected.  20 mph and 80 mph zones are 1 in 2.  70 mph and 75 mph are 1 in 6.  Most people travel 5-15 mph above the (sometimes unreasonable) speed limits.  70 mph and 75 mph are probably so low because most people don't really speed there - they're going fast enough.\n\nHere's construction zones plotted against speeding (I haven't figured out why the totals are different, but it's what I could pull out):\n\n![Construction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhyrr/mhyrr.github.com/master/images/workzonevspeeding.jpg)\n\nOnly 1% of fatal incidents happen in construction zones, and the numbers aren't much different.  About 1 in 3.5 accidents involves speeding.  While it's certainly important to protect construction workers, I'm not convinced there's any greater damage here, especially considering:\n\n![Types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhyrr/mhyrr.github.com/master/images/workzonevtype.jpg)\n\nPedestrians have a lower chance (1 in 30 fatalities) to be hit in a construction zone than they do on a normal road (1 in 15 fatalities)!\n\n*Note, this data isn't meant to be rigorous or complete, only to show that speeding and construction zones aren't the big problems speed cameras are trying to fix.*  So yeah, not so impressed with those stationary speed cameras.\n\nThe sad thing is, car accidents are a significant problem in our country.  They have a relatively high injury and fatality rate per mile traveled.  The automakers have led the charge to reduce these rates, designing incredibly safe cars compared to those of past eras.  The evidence is in the crash-test pudding:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/1_ptUrQOMPs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nOur policies for drivers need to follow this lead.

The average driver, with but 6 hours of \"real-world\" driving experience at a school can acquire a license with no real concept of how to handle a vehicle.\n* Enforcement of reasonable driving policies needs to be strict.  Only passing on the left, staying right except for overtaking, serious penalties for speeding based on real speed limits (I'd be in favor of penalties well over $1000 for driving too fast in a neighborhood), and real and reasonable speed limits are the top items on my list.

Le Corbusier, a pseudonym he gave himself, was an early twentieth century architect obsessed with engineering as architecture, concrete, steel, height, cubism, and urban planning.  \n\nSo what's the big deal?

His imitators and students are just as bad, and just as focused on awful urban designs.  I.M. Pei is the most obvious; he says of his Dallas City Hall design that he wanted it to \"convey an image of the people.\"  Observe:\n\n![Dallas City Hall](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/DallasCityHallB.jpg/600px-DallasCityHallB.jpg)\n\nRight.  This conveys the feeling of an architectural big brother, crafted for the government, and watching as we scurry around.

Really.\n\n![Louvre](http://famouswonders.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/louvre-museum.jpg)\n\nFortunately, urban planning seems to be migrating much more towards the [New Urbanism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Urbanism) movement - away from concrete and towards diversity, away from cars and towards pedestrians.  Consider this comparison between Corbusier and Jane Jacobs, one of the earliest critics of 20th century urbanism.  \n\nCorbusier:\n\n\tWe must create a mass-production state of mind:\n\tA state of mind for building mass-production housing.\n\tA state of mind for living in mass-production housing.\n\tA state of mind for conceiving mass-production housing.\n\nJane Jacobs (from [The Death and Life of Great American Cities](http://www.amazon.com/American-Cities-Anniversary-Edition-Library/dp/0679644334/ref=reg_hu-rd_add_1_dp)):\n\n\tThe necessity for these four conditions is the most important point this book has to make. \n\tIn combination, these conditions create effective economic pools of use:\n\t\tMixed uses, activating streets at different times of the day\n\t\tShort blocks, allowing high pedestrian permeability.\n\t\tBuildings of various ages & states of repair.\n\t\tDensity.\n\nIt's ants vs. humans.\n\nThe most interesting consequence of the likes of Corbusier and I.M. Pei comes from their ingenuousness.  They really meant to be helping make the world better, and they followed their perspective to the extremes of their genius and ability.  Corbusier famously said that \"The house is a machine for living in.\"  He really believed it, and he really believed his perspective would help make us better.\n\nThat's something we are called upon in our culture to do constantly; we follow our passion, we follow our beliefs.  But what if our beliefs are wrong?  What if we're following the wrong problem?  In a culture so built on relativism, the [truthiness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truthiness) of the solution is what matters.  \n\nFollowing that line of thinking and self-centered progress is exactly what caused Corbusier to fuck things up so badly.  He genuinely wanted to help solve large problems in the world: poverty, poor living conditions, inefficiency.  But the solution for these things isn't architecture.  Wealth solves poverty.  Wealth solves living conditions.  Inefficiency is a qualitative part of the human condition and one which we should perhaps embrace more than we do in modern society, as it has amongst its positive side effects the promise of serendipity.\n\nThe next few decades will see a revolution in the planning of towns and cities, and the blight of 20th century architecture will slowly disappear.  It's the kind of revolution Corbusier wanted to kill off.  \"Architecture or revolution. Revolution can be avoided.\" he said.  Although, perhaps it's not as bad as he thought.  \n\n![Varenna](http://riskman.smugmug.com/Travel/Europe-Trip-2011/i-7zQdhjr/0/M/IMG3739-M.jpg)\n\nThe larger moral question of pursuing the truth remains.  The abandonment of truth for truthiness, so easy in our modern era, needs a level of [meta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta)-thinking that is still unfortunately rarely seen.  We need to build frameworks for more intellectual honesty and questioning to understand the impact of either wrong solutions or wrong problems.  These all start with truth and have some sort of honestly that allows sideways and contrarian views to turn problems around.

Much could be said of his life, but the quality that seems strongest is his biting honestly.  He was brutally, scathingly honest in voicing his opinion, and his honesty broke only when he trended towards sensationalism.\n\nHitchens wrote with such opinionated honesty in a stunningly negative obituary of Mother Teresa in 2003.  It would be memorable for no other reason than its unusual negativity towards a woman endeared to so many.  But I remember it for one peculiar phrase Hitchens used.  He said, \"Mother Teresa was not a friend of the poor.  She was a friend of poverty.\"\n\nHowever true or false this statement may be, the idea behind it is powerful enough to be one of the main reasons the educated elite around the world trend towards atheism.\n\nThe perception of religion around the world is enjoined with the idea of a simple life, especially in America.  An uneducated superstition about how religion affects our world makes the impression of a Luddite faith even more distinct.  Technologically, one need go no farther than the Quaker communities.  Their use of arbitrarily simple tools and no electricity make an obvious example of simplicity.  Culturally, the southern evangelicals tend to lead this trend.  They thump their Bibles and quote out-of-context Gospel verses or make sure we know that \"everything happens for a reason.\" (one of my favorite phrases).  Religious faith has caused people to claim that the will of God affects everything from the outcome of the Presidential election to September 11th to a touchdown throw.  Religion even let's people turn their faulty faith on the funeral's of dead soldiers, as we've seen from the Westboro Baptist Church.\n\nI hesitate strongly to correlate all of these examples under one bucket.  Still, there's a sort of intellectual shoulder shrug that often happens when people relate their faith with the world around them.  They provide overly-simplified causes and patterns to make themselves feel better about ignorance in a vast and wild world.  This sort of teleological argument happens everywhere.  Subsistence tribes around the world conjure supernatural explanations for all sorts of phenomena from why the shaman died to where the rains came from.  We do the exact same thing to explain car crashes or good luck.  It's natural - humans are pattern-seekers in everything - and I don't intend to provide judgment here, only observation.\n\nThe concern with this simplification is that the world is *not* a simple place.  It is extraordinarily complex, and as we learn more and more, it only gets more complex and intriguing.\n\nNew characteristics of our world over time show us just how complex it is.  Even something as self-evident as a global concept of \"now\" is less than two hundred years old, when telegraphs were invented and became popular.  Before that, all news was old news in an almost historical sense.  Time zones didn't exist or need to exist.  Noon was noon and that was that.  (Some new clients of telegraphs would walk in with a written message to send to a friend, and then complain that the message wasn't sent because they were still holding the piece of paper on which it was written.)  The easy duplication and communication of information was totally and completely brand new.  We take it for granted today.  What, I wonder, will our grandchildren take for granted?\n\nMost of the ways in which we illuminate our beautifully complex world fall under a single heading: science.  Science, in conjunction with her bosom friends mathematics and engineering, is the method by which we use observations and tests to provide explanations to the world around us.  It's a way of systematizing knowledge.  \n\nUnfortunately, it seems to most people as if religion and science are fighting a centuries old battle of literally Copernican proportions.  Copernicus is the last great scientist most people think of in reference to the Church, and all they know of him was that he was shunned and fought.  Most don't know that he was also a cleric of Canon Law and may have even become a priest.\n\n### Wonder and Beauty\n\nThis past Christmas, my five year old godson had a \"Science Kit\" at the top of his list of presents.  I was so excited by this that I couldn't help but fulfill his request.  He is now frustrating his Mom endlessly with cries of \"Come see this!\" because he's found something new under his microscope.  He's looked at everything from the fibers of paper, the tiny portrait of Lincoln in his memorial on the back of a penny, rocks, quartz, paramecium, and algae from a stream near his house.  He's completely excited by his observations.\n\nI was more excited about giving this present than any other - including a Bible or some other religious gift - for a very fundamental reason.  At the age of five, my godson is only just learning to read.  He much prefers to scrape his knees outside and climb fences that are too tall.  He wouldn't like the Bible at all, and not a single word would have sunk in for years.  On the other hand, a science kit provides a very practical excitement about one of the most natural human sentiments: learning and a search for the truth.  Truth is the thing that both religion and science seek and humans lack.\n\nThe perceived battles between science and religion through the centuries are caused by this fundamental search for truth.  Science is the human method by which we test the data we can consume from the world around us.  Religion is the prescription of truth based on faith, philosophy and our reaction to the world around us.  \n\nWhile I was not enthused about Hitchens' Mother Teresa obit, I have also seen him engage in very dignified and exciting debates.  Several excerpts of one such debate between [Hitchens and Msgr. Lorenzo Albacete are on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raAyxJo2FJ0&feature=related&noredirect=1), in which they discuss the great questions of science and religion.  Hitchens makes an exceptional point in the debate.  He separates the \"numinous\" - that is, the transcendent - from the supernatural.  And he cites examples, saying that Michelangelo could paint the Sistine Chapel without belief, that Verdi could write the Requiem without belief, and that anyone can see the stunning beauty and grandeur of the Greek Parthenon without believing in the ancient Greek religions.  He says in fact that a miracle would *not* make him believe, but rather, in homage to Hume, would make him doubt even his own senses.\n\nAs great as Hitchens' observations are, Msgr. Albacete makes the debate.  He interjects at this point to make his agreement with Hitchens' known, and in fact to say that Jesus Christ himself would agree - that Christ did not think very much of miracles.  Albacete paraphrases Christ's words that they will not believe even if you raise a man from the dead, and adds that Christ put everything on love: the world would believe only to the extent that you love one another.\n\nHow different a perspective is this from a priest than what we might normally expect from a believer?  Msgr. Albacete is certainly a remarkable priest with a vibrant past.  Now in charge of the Communion & Liberation movement in the US, he was a physicist before donning his collar.  Albacete goes on to say that he is in complete agreement with the rational, logical explanations for unbelief that Hitchens' provides.  Instead, he says, there is something personal, something about how to live life and learn love that does not allow him to stop with the rational.\n\nThe difference between a religious trust in the supernatural and the fundamental faith of Msgr. Albacete is quite astounding.  The supernatural and simple faith of many religious as it affects the world is subject to the logical and rational workings of the world.  A faith based on the orthogonal perspective of love cannot be.  It would be wrong to say that science fails here; rather, religion and science are \"two windows that people look through, trying to understand the big universe outside\" as Freeman Dyson* says.  Science cannot explain the radical love of Christ just as religion cannot deduce the laws of quantum electrodynamics.\n\n### Cicadas and Evolution\n\nIt seems reasonable at this point to provide an explanation for what prompted this essay.  I recently had a great conversation with a friend regarding the Presidential views on the teaching of intelligent design in schools as a competitor to evolution in science class.  I vehemently disagree with this idea on two levels.  First, I cannot express enough discontent that this relatively small issue gains such large traction at the level of the election of the President, especially because voters use it as a barometer of religious belief.  Second, and more importantly, **intelligent design is not science.**  This is completely fundamental, and no amount of wishing will make it so.  Evolution as a theory is the description of patterns of change over time that fit biologic data.  Intelligent design is philosophical in nature, or sometimes religious.  It's not that intelligent design has no place in school, it simply has no place in the science classroom.  It most definitely belongs in a philosophy, civics, or history class and would be an exceedingly interesting field of study.\n\nThis question on intelligent design naturally brought about an even more basic question of evolution.  Evolution, put extremely simply, is a change over time in organisms.  It is a real phenomenon.  A huge amount of the population still has problems with this, and I'm convinced that the problem is mostly the word \"theory\".  Theory can have two meanings.  On the one hand, theory is a sort of hypothesis to a line of questioning.  On the other, it is a more rigorous description based off of available data.  Evolutionary **theory** is theoretical in the same was as the Pythagorean Theory or plate-tectonic theory.  It is a real phenomenon evident everywhere from the fossil record to fruit-fly experiments to cultural changes to computer programming (Evolutionary algorithms can be used to provide solutions to complex optimization problems by inspecting and evolving patterns over time from a starting population.)  We shouldn't be surprised by the issue of lexicology in science.  The word \"science\" itself is used and misused - and I've completely bastardized it herein.  Science is a synecdoche of itself.  My friend [Edwin](https://www.facebook.com/edwin.liu) best described it: \"science [is] a methodology, science [is] an institution, and science [is] a body of knowledge.\"\n\nIn evolution, scientific examples of hidden complexity abound.  The 13 and 17 year cicada populations are some of my favorite examples of a certain trait evolving over time.  How many kids have asked why these creatures only appear very occasionally?  Computer models of predator-prey behavior have shown that these intervals evolved (were learned perhaps?) over time based on the gestational cycles of the predators.  By skipping years, the cicadas are able to thrive when the predators will have the smallest effect.  By trending towards a prime number of years, the cicadas skip all the predators with 1, 2, 3, or 4 year cycles.  \n\nIt's important to note too that, at a philosophical level, the scientific notion of evolution does not proscribe the philosophical notion of intelligent design.  There is no evidence that the two are mutually exclusive.  Pope Pius XII distinguishes between the body and the soul in *Humani Generis* and provides for the scientific study of evolution, \"in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter\".\n\nEvolution has been the largest wedge between science and religion since heliocentrism.  Ironically, perhaps the best view of these two actors comes from evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould, who described science and religion as \"non-overlapping magisteria\".  Gould borrowed the term \"magisteria\" from *Humani Generis* and in fact uses the notion of the soul as one of his prime examples:\n\n\tReligion is too important to too many people for any dismissal or denigration of the comfort \n\tstill sought by many folks from theology. I may, for example, privately suspect that papal\n\tinsistence on divine infusion of the soul represents a sop to our fears, a device for \n\tmaintaining a belief in human superiority within an evolutionary world offering no \n\tprivileged position to any creature. But I also know that souls represent a subject outside \n\tthe magisterium of science. My world cannot prove or disprove such a notion, and the concept\n\tof souls cannot threaten or impact my domain. Moreover, while I cannot personally accept\n\tthe Catholic view of souls, I surely honor the metaphorical value of such a concept both \n\tfor grounding moral discussion and for expressing what we most value about human potentiality:\n\tour decency, care, and all the ethical and intellectual struggles that the evolution of\n\tconsciousness imposed upon us. \n\nI foster a fear that, as pleasant as this solution of mutual exclusivity may seem, it remains too simplistic.  Certainly many sociobiologists, and chiefly Richard Dawkins among them, would disagree.  I remain tepid myself, as my rational and scientific outlook holds the (perhaps delusional) notion that the entire world is a knowable system.  Maybe it isn't.  Certainly there is a third, and oft overlooked, player in the game: philosophy.  \n\nPhilosophy and the study of knowledge, reality, existence, and truth provides a confluence of questions in which science and religion sometimes get lost.  Nobody disputes the science around organic chemistry, for example, unless it somehow interferes with their (possibly religious) worldview.  Religion is a system of belief that hopes to provide frameworks to these sorts of questions, just as science sometimes does, both from completely different directions.  The questions of philosophy are the views we see through Dyson's two windows.  Here perhaps we could learn from Wittgenstein's view in his philosophical opus **Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus**, which begins with the Lemma \"The world is everything that is the case.\"  He ends, one hundred pages later, with the statement \"whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.\"  \n\nWhile it's possible for science and religion to overlap and each contribute to the aggregated learning of a given philosophical question, perhaps it's enough to provide for some humility in each perspective.\n\n### Scientist Saints\n\nThroughout the history of Christianity, the focus of Christ's radical love has been incredibly personal.  St. Paul, St. Augustine, and St. Francis of Assisi all provide examples of this overwhelming power in their ways of life.  More recently, St. Therese of Lisieux described the most humble Way of the Little Flower.  Her letters provide insight into an intense and utterly small focus on love in little steps.  Mother Teresa embodied this same Way for our generation.  She provided simple examples of love that were right in front of her.\n\nIn this tradition, Hitchens' criticism is completely unfounded.  But his commentary still points out a glaring hole in the fabric of capabilities that love can provide today.\n\nIn the past, the great minds and thinkers of the Church gravitated towards higher episcopal positions or seats of philosophical thinking.  They made tremendous impacts in learning on philosophy and on the movement of the Church and the people towards love.  But the Church has a tremendous history of scientific thinkers as well, one that often goes unnoticed.\n\nAmong priests and clerics alone we have many tremendous examples.  Fr. Gregor Mendel founded genetics.  Msgr. Georges Lemaitre hypothesized the Big Bang.  William of Ockham - who proposed Occam's Razor - was a Franciscan.  Fr. Walter Ong studied the cultural shift from oral history to literacy.  Fr. Stanley Jaki received his doctorate in physics under the advisement of a Nobel Laureate.  There are craters on the moon named after scholarly priests and the Vatican Observatory still does astronomical research in Arizona.\n\nWhat's so important about this tradition is the radical shift that science has provided the world in the last few hundred years.  When the Church was debating heliocentric theories in the 16th century, the application of this science was entirely philosophical.  Today, the impact of science on the world is tremendous.  Science and engineering has provided an abundance of energy, sanitation, machinery, information and higher standards of life.  Science and engineering have moved in a dramatic way from strictly theoretical to something that can touch the everyday and the mundane.  It hasn't changed in any drastic way, it's tools have simply gotten much better.  Computers are only the latest in a series of world changing scientific and industrial movements.  Scientists have the capability to impact the world profoundly.\n\nIn the 40s and 50s, Norman Borlaug was doing experimental plant genetics on wheat crops in Mexico.  His work drove new varieties of dwarf wheat with huge increases in per-acre harvest rates and resistance to drought and disease.  In the 1960s, Borlaug brought these new strains of wheat to India in the midst of a population explosion.  The population was growing so quickly that most experts expected tens or even hundreds of millions to starve to death.  Economist Paul Ehrlich wrote a book called *The Population Bomb* describing a frightening future of poverty and hunger.  Fortunately, his prophesy proved false.  Over the next decade, Borlaug worked around India to seed the new wheat strains and increase crop yields.  With his help, the Green Revolution in India took off, crops exploded, and the multitudes were fed.\tLater, he received a Nobel Peace Prize for his work.\n\nIn some ways perhaps, the small acts of love conceived by some of our greatest saints are no different than the small curiosity of Borlaug.  He was interested in a small problem, plant genetics and agronomy, and was able to improve the lives of hundreds of millions.  Here is a complex scientific solution to a conceptually simple but practically complex problem - feeding the multitudes.  Borlaug helped ensure that they could be fed, so that later Mother Teresa could help inspire the same country towards love.  \n\nSimilar examples of small curiosities making big impacts are available today.  One of my favorites is Nathan Myhrvold, former CTO at Microsoft.  Myhrvold led a team to develop an extraordinary and wildly fun to watch laser system that literally shoots the wings off mosquitoes to prevent the spread of malaria.  They've also studied the migration of malaria over time in populations to better understand the most effective ways to prevent the disease.\n\nComputer scientists often play huge roles in this type of work.  A certain type of person migrates towards manipulating computers - which requires a sort of brutal and disinterested honesty to perform well - and seems to be a peculiar flavor of scientist.  Computer scientists (or hackers or nerds if you prefer) bend computer systems to their will by being (sometimes annoyingly) efficient at discovering the truth of rules and systems.  They manipulate those rules for their benefit and learn exactly what inputs are needed to generate certain outputs.  When computer scientists take this skill into other fields, they continue to apply it rigorously.\n\nWe need more examples of this.  We need more scientist saints.  Just as we need the guidance of saints for simple interpersonal acts of love, we need the guidance of saints for turning simple scientific, mathematical or engineering study into acts of love.\n\nThe Church calls on us to contribute each in our own way as members of the Body of Christ.  The Way of the Little Flower and Mother Teresa's focus on small acts of love are often much more approachable to more people.  Opus Dei helps us find holiness in our daily lives.  Still, the capacity now to influence the world positively is larger than ever before in history and there are more ways to do it.  The more examples of this love we have, the better off we'll be.  Most people don't know about the Vatican Observatory of the work of Fr. Walter Ong.  They only know the fight of Galileo or the many Christians that dispute Charles Darwin.\n\nThe capacity to turn science towards love presents one other problem in Hitchens' obit of Mother Teresa.  He ridiculed her love of suffering and saw it as a huge paradox in her work.  The problem in his reasoning can be seen in the contrast to suffering.  The opposite of suffering isn't comfort, as the modern humanistic view might have us believe, but apathy.  Mother Teresa loved suffering because she loved.  The many poor in India are not a mark of failure, but act of loving the poor is a sign of success.  \n\nThe better we can turn all of our human endeavors towards love, including science, the more we can reconcile humanity to Christ, to itself, to the understanding of our world, and to the understanding of each other.\n\nIn the meantime, I'll pray to Albertus Magnus - the patron of natural scientists, Isidore of Seville - the patron of computer scientists, Dominic - the patron of scientists, and Patrick - the patron of engineers, for a call to reconcile science to love and for love to be more ably seen in our human understanding of the world around us.\n\n---\n\n* Freeman Dyson (one of my heroes) - a more complete quote: \"Science and religion are two windows that people look through, trying to understand the big universe outside, trying to understand why we are here. The two windows give different views, but they look out at the same universe. Both views are one-sided, neither is complete. Both leave out essential features of the real world. And both are worthy of respect.  Trouble arises when either science or religion claims universal jurisdiction, when either religious or scientific dogma claims to be infallible. Religious creationists and scientific materialists are equally dogmatic and insensitive. By their arrogance they bring both science and religion into disrepute. The media exaggerate their numbers and importance. The media rarely mention the fact that the great majority of religious people belong to moderate denominations that treat science with respect, or the fact that the great majority of scientists treat religion with respect so long as religion does not claim jurisdiction over scientific questions.\" from his acceptance speed of the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge68.html\n","html":"<h3 id=\"asimplelife\">A Simple Life</h3>\n\n<p>Christopher Hitchens died recently.  Much could be said of his life, but the quality that seems strongest is his biting honestly.  He was brutally, scathingly honest in voicing his opinion, and his honesty broke only when he trended towards sensationalism.</p>\n\n<p>Hitchens wrote with such opinionated honesty in a stunningly negative obituary of Mother Teresa in 2003.  It would be memorable for no other reason than its unusual negativity towards a woman endeared to so many.  But I remember it for one peculiar phrase Hitchens used.  He said, \"Mother Teresa was not a friend of the poor.  She was a friend of poverty.\"</p>\n\n<p>However true or false this statement may be, the idea behind it is powerful enough to be one of the main reasons the educated elite around the world trend towards atheism.</p>\n\n<p>The perception of religion around the world is enjoined with the idea of a simple life, especially in America.  An uneducated superstition about how religion affects our world makes the impression of a Luddite faith even more distinct.  Technologically, one need go no farther than the Quaker communities.  Their use of arbitrarily simple tools and no electricity make an obvious example of simplicity.  Culturally, the southern evangelicals tend to lead this trend.  They thump their Bibles and quote out-of-context Gospel verses or make sure we know that \"everything happens for a reason.\" (one of my favorite phrases).  Religious faith has caused people to claim that the will of God affects everything from the outcome of the Presidential election to September 11th to a touchdown throw.  Religion even let's people turn their faulty faith on the funeral's of dead soldiers, as we've seen from the Westboro Baptist Church.</p>\n\n<p>I hesitate strongly to correlate all of these examples under one bucket.  Still, there's a sort of intellectual shoulder shrug that often happens when people relate their faith with the world around them.  They provide overly-simplified causes and patterns to make themselves feel better about ignorance in a vast and wild world.  This sort of teleological argument happens everywhere.  Subsistence tribes around the world conjure supernatural explanations for all sorts of phenomena from why the shaman died to where the rains came from.  We do the exact same thing to explain car crashes or good luck.  It's natural - humans are pattern-seekers in everything - and I don't intend to provide judgment here, only observation.</p>\n\n<p>The concern with this simplification is that the world is <em>not</em> a simple place.  It is extraordinarily complex, and as we learn more and more, it only gets more complex and intriguing.</p>\n\n<p>New characteristics of our world over time show us just how complex it is.  Even something as self-evident as a global concept of \"now\" is less than two hundred years old, when telegraphs were invented and became popular.  Before that, all news was old news in an almost historical sense.  Time zones didn't exist or need to exist.  Noon was noon and that was that.  (Some new clients of telegraphs would walk in with a written message to send to a friend, and then complain that the message wasn't sent because they were still holding the piece of paper on which it was written.)  The easy duplication and communication of information was totally and completely brand new.  We take it for granted today.  What, I wonder, will our grandchildren take for granted?</p>\n\n<p>Most of the ways in which we illuminate our beautifully complex world fall under a single heading: science.  Science, in conjunction with her bosom friends mathematics and engineering, is the method by which we use observations and tests to provide explanations to the world around us.  It's a way of systematizing knowledge.  </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, it seems to most people as if religion and science are fighting a centuries old battle of literally Copernican proportions.  Copernicus is the last great scientist most people think of in reference to the Church, and all they know of him was that he was shunned and fought.  Most don't know that he was also a cleric of Canon Law and may have even become a priest.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wonderandbeauty\">Wonder and Beauty</h3>\n\n<p>This past Christmas, my five year old godson had a \"Science Kit\" at the top of his list of presents.  I was so excited by this that I couldn't help but fulfill his request.  He is now frustrating his Mom endlessly with cries of \"Come see this!\" because he's found something new under his microscope.  He's looked at everything from the fibers of paper, the tiny portrait of Lincoln in his memorial on the back of a penny, rocks, quartz, paramecium, and algae from a stream near his house.  He's completely excited by his observations.</p>\n\n<p>I was more excited about giving this present than any other - including a Bible or some other religious gift - for a very fundamental reason.  At the age of five, my godson is only just learning to read.  He much prefers to scrape his knees outside and climb fences that are too tall.  He wouldn't like the Bible at all, and not a single word would have sunk in for years.  On the other hand, a science kit provides a very practical excitement about one of the most natural human sentiments: learning and a search for the truth.  Truth is the thing that both religion and science seek and humans lack.</p>\n\n<p>The perceived battles between science and religion through the centuries are caused by this fundamental search for truth.  Science is the human method by which we test the data we can consume from the world around us.  Religion is the prescription of truth based on faith, philosophy and our reaction to the world around us.  </p>\n\n<p>While I was not enthused about Hitchens' Mother Teresa obit, I have also seen him engage in very dignified and exciting debates.  Several excerpts of one such debate between <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raAyxJo2FJ0&amp;feature=related&amp;noredirect=1\">Hitchens and Msgr. Lorenzo Albacete are on Youtube</a>, in which they discuss the great questions of science and religion.  Hitchens makes an exceptional point in the debate.  He separates the \"numinous\" - that is, the transcendent - from the supernatural.  And he cites examples, saying that Michelangelo could paint the Sistine Chapel without belief, that Verdi could write the Requiem without belief, and that anyone can see the stunning beauty and grandeur of the Greek Parthenon without believing in the ancient Greek religions.  He says in fact that a miracle would <em>not</em> make him believe, but rather, in homage to Hume, would make him doubt even his own senses.</p>\n\n<p>As great as Hitchens' observations are, Msgr. Albacete makes the debate.  He interjects at this point to make his agreement with Hitchens' known, and in fact to say that Jesus Christ himself would agree - that Christ did not think very much of miracles.  Albacete paraphrases Christ's words that they will not believe even if you raise a man from the dead, and adds that Christ put everything on love: the world would believe only to the extent that you love one another.</p>\n\n<p>How different a perspective is this from a priest than what we might normally expect from a believer?  Msgr. Albacete is certainly a remarkable priest with a vibrant past.  Now in charge of the Communion &amp; Liberation movement in the US, he was a physicist before donning his collar.  Albacete goes on to say that he is in complete agreement with the rational, logical explanations for unbelief that Hitchens' provides.  Instead, he says, there is something personal, something about how to live life and learn love that does not allow him to stop with the rational.</p>\n\n<p>The difference between a religious trust in the supernatural and the fundamental faith of Msgr. Albacete is quite astounding.  The supernatural and simple faith of many religious as it affects the world is subject to the logical and rational workings of the world.  A faith based on the orthogonal perspective of love cannot be.  It would be wrong to say that science fails here; rather, religion and science are \"two windows that people look through, trying to understand the big universe outside\" as Freeman Dyson* says.  Science cannot explain the radical love of Christ just as religion cannot deduce the laws of quantum electrodynamics.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"cicadasandevolution\">Cicadas and Evolution</h3>\n\n<p>It seems reasonable at this point to provide an explanation for what prompted this essay.  I recently had a great conversation with a friend regarding the Presidential views on the teaching of intelligent design in schools as a competitor to evolution in science class.  I vehemently disagree with this idea on two levels.  First, I cannot express enough discontent that this relatively small issue gains such large traction at the level of the election of the President, especially because voters use it as a barometer of religious belief.  Second, and more importantly, <strong>intelligent design is not science.</strong>  This is completely fundamental, and no amount of wishing will make it so.  Evolution as a theory is the description of patterns of change over time that fit biologic data.  Intelligent design is philosophical in nature, or sometimes religious.  It's not that intelligent design has no place in school, it simply has no place in the science classroom.  It most definitely belongs in a philosophy, civics, or history class and would be an exceedingly interesting field of study.</p>\n\n<p>This question on intelligent design naturally brought about an even more basic question of evolution.  Evolution, put extremely simply, is a change over time in organisms.  It is a real phenomenon.  A huge amount of the population still has problems with this, and I'm convinced that the problem is mostly the word \"theory\".  Theory can have two meanings.  On the one hand, theory is a sort of hypothesis to a line of questioning.  On the other, it is a more rigorous description based off of available data.  Evolutionary <strong>theory</strong> is theoretical in the same was as the Pythagorean Theory or plate-tectonic theory.  It is a real phenomenon evident everywhere from the fossil record to fruit-fly experiments to cultural changes to computer programming (Evolutionary algorithms can be used to provide solutions to complex optimization problems by inspecting and evolving patterns over time from a starting population.)  We shouldn't be surprised by the issue of lexicology in science.  The word \"science\" itself is used and misused - and I've completely bastardized it herein.  Science is a synecdoche of itself.  My friend <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/edwin.liu\">Edwin</a> best described it: \"science [is] a methodology, science [is] an institution, and science [is] a body of knowledge.\"</p>\n\n<p>In evolution, scientific examples of hidden complexity abound.  The 13 and 17 year cicada populations are some of my favorite examples of a certain trait evolving over time.  How many kids have asked why these creatures only appear very occasionally?  Computer models of predator-prey behavior have shown that these intervals evolved (were learned perhaps?) over time based on the gestational cycles of the predators.  By skipping years, the cicadas are able to thrive when the predators will have the smallest effect.  By trending towards a prime number of years, the cicadas skip all the predators with 1, 2, 3, or 4 year cycles.  </p>\n\n<p>It's important to note too that, at a philosophical level, the scientific notion of evolution does not proscribe the philosophical notion of intelligent design.  There is no evidence that the two are mutually exclusive.  Pope Pius XII distinguishes between the body and the soul in <em>Humani Generis</em> and provides for the scientific study of evolution, \"in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter\".</p>\n\n<p>Evolution has been the largest wedge between science and religion since heliocentrism.  Ironically, perhaps the best view of these two actors comes from evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould, who described science and religion as \"non-overlapping magisteria\".  Gould borrowed the term \"magisteria\" from <em>Humani Generis</em> and in fact uses the notion of the soul as one of his prime examples:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Religion is too important to too many people for any dismissal or denigration of the comfort \nstill sought by many folks from theology. I may, for example, privately suspect that papal\ninsistence on divine infusion of the soul represents a sop to our fears, a device for \nmaintaining a belief in human superiority within an evolutionary world offering no \nprivileged position to any creature. But I also know that souls represent a subject outside \nthe magisterium of science. My world cannot prove or disprove such a notion, and the concept\nof souls cannot threaten or impact my domain. Moreover, while I cannot personally accept\nthe Catholic view of souls, I surely honor the metaphorical value of such a concept both \nfor grounding moral discussion and for expressing what we most value about human potentiality:\nour decency, care, and all the ethical and intellectual struggles that the evolution of\nconsciousness imposed upon us. \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I foster a fear that, as pleasant as this solution of mutual exclusivity may seem, it remains too simplistic.  Certainly many sociobiologists, and chiefly Richard Dawkins among them, would disagree.  I remain tepid myself, as my rational and scientific outlook holds the (perhaps delusional) notion that the entire world is a knowable system.  Maybe it isn't.  Certainly there is a third, and oft overlooked, player in the game: philosophy.  </p>\n\n<p>Philosophy and the study of knowledge, reality, existence, and truth provides a confluence of questions in which science and religion sometimes get lost.  Nobody disputes the science around organic chemistry, for example, unless it somehow interferes with their (possibly religious) worldview.  Religion is a system of belief that hopes to provide frameworks to these sorts of questions, just as science sometimes does, both from completely different directions.  The questions of philosophy are the views we see through Dyson's two windows.  Here perhaps we could learn from Wittgenstein's view in his philosophical opus <strong>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</strong>, which begins with the Lemma \"The world is everything that is the case.\"  He ends, one hundred pages later, with the statement \"whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.\"  </p>\n\n<p>While it's possible for science and religion to overlap and each contribute to the aggregated learning of a given philosophical question, perhaps it's enough to provide for some humility in each perspective.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scientistsaints\">Scientist Saints</h3>\n\n<p>Throughout the history of Christianity, the focus of Christ's radical love has been incredibly personal.  St. Paul, St. Augustine, and St. Francis of Assisi all provide examples of this overwhelming power in their ways of life.  More recently, St. Therese of Lisieux described the most humble Way of the Little Flower.  Her letters provide insight into an intense and utterly small focus on love in little steps.  Mother Teresa embodied this same Way for our generation.  She provided simple examples of love that were right in front of her.</p>\n\n<p>In this tradition, Hitchens' criticism is completely unfounded.  But his commentary still points out a glaring hole in the fabric of capabilities that love can provide today.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, the great minds and thinkers of the Church gravitated towards higher episcopal positions or seats of philosophical thinking.

My height is 6'1 and my weight is slightly over 250 (I'm not sure of the exact number, I'll find that out tomorrow morning).  I've always been pretty athletic, and for the last ten years or so my weight has been almost exactly 240.  That's a lot, I know.  I'm a pretty big guy naturally (or as a friend put it, with a positive spin, I'm built like a brick shithouse).  I've never put much emphasis on anything but being strong, so as long as I could run a couple of miles in a decent time, that was enough.\n\nI don't have too many good measures for where I am physically.  I was irregularly running a couple of miles at a time over the summer.  I could probably do a reasonable 5K, but it wouldn't be fun.  \n\nI have a better measure of strength.  In the spring, I did 17 reps of 225 on bench press, which puts me on the lower end of Running Backs in the NFL Combine ([Alfred Morris](http://m.nfl.com/combine/profile/2533457/alfred-morris/), for all you Skins fans, did 16).\n\nOver the past year, my weight has gone up ever so slightly.  I could attribute this to any number of things - I'm getting older, my wife and I had our first child, the stress of buying a new house or the stress of work.  Maybe all of the above, but they're happy excuses and I'm not interested.  I got a bit frightened because my steady weight suddenly popped up in a way it never has.  It's not a lot (on my frame you can't even tell), but it's enough to want to reverse the trend.  \n\nThis is really a lifestyle change with a few months of jumpstarting.  In the end, lifestyle is what matters.  I eat like shit and I know it.  I've always been able to get away with it, but I'm at the age now where that slows down ever so slightly, priorities change ever so slightly and the beginning of the 40 year old belly takes hold.  So now is the time to correct what I don't want in 8 years.\n\nTo do so, I'm going to have a few months of hard work ahead of me.  Following that, I hope to enter an indefinite maintenance period, likely with staccatos of hard work to stay steady.  For now, I'm focused on the first few months.\n\n## Regimen\n\nHere's what I will be doing:\n\n### Diet\n\nI'll be using the [Slow Carb Diet](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/04/06/how-to-lose-20-lbs-of-fat-in-30-days-without-doing-any-exercise/) espoused by Tim Ferris.  There are 4 rules:\n\tAvoid White Carbohydrates\n\tEat the same meals over and over again\n\tDon't drink calories\n\tTake one day off per week and go crazy, eating anything and everything you want.\n\nIn practice, this means a protein and vegetable rich diet, with beans and lentils for carbs.  I'll be following pretty close to this, focusing on eggs/egg whites in the morning, a Protein shake, leftover meats and veggies for lunch and meats and veggies for dinner.  The only alcohol allowed will be red wine.  Saturday will be my cheat day.\n\nI tried this diet for just over 2 weeks in August and lost 12 lbs.\n\n### Workouts\n\nI'll be focusing on strength training, ala [Starting Strength](http://www.amazon.com/Starting-Strength-3rd-Mark-Rippetoe/dp/0982522738).  Here's what I will be following, roughly:\n\nLegs:\n\tSquats (4x12) - 225-275\n\tSuperset\n\t    Lunges - 3x10 - 40 lb dumbbells\n\t    Straight Leg Deadlift - 3x10 - 135\n\t    Leg Press - 3x10 - 460-640\n\tLeg Curls - 3x12 - 60\n\tLeg Extensions - 8x10 w/ 10 second rests - start at 110 lbs and go down as needed\n\tCalf Raises - 100 reps, few sets as possible\n\tSitups and Planks\n\nChest/Shoulder/Tri:\n\tBench Press - 4x10 - 150-225\n\tSuperset\n\t    Dumbbell incline bench - 3x10 - 50 lb dumbbells\n\t    Incline Flies - 3x10 - 40 lb dumbbells\n\t    Dips - 3x10\n\tPushups - 8x10 w/ 10 second rests (ugh)\n\tStanding Military Press - 3x10 - 95\n\tSuperset\n\t    Arnolds - 3x12 - 40 lb dumbbells\n\t    Lateral Delt Flies - 3x12 - 15 lb dumbbells\n\t    Bent Over Flies - 3x12 - 15 lb dumbbells\n\tSuperset\n\t    Close Grip Bench - 3x12 - 95\n\t    Tricep pushdown - 3x12 - 110\n\t    Dips - 3x12\n\tSitups and Planks\n\nBack/Biceps:\n\tDead Lifts - 4x12 - 225-325\n\tBarbell Rows - 3x10 - 135-155\n\tSuperpset\n\t    Dumbbell rows - 3x10 - 65\n\t    Straight arm pull downs - 3x10 - 100\n\t    Lat pull downs - 3x10 - 120\n\tTbar Rows - 3x10 - 135\n\tShoulder Shrugs - 4x15 - 270\n\tSuperset\n\t    Curl Bar - 3x10 - 75\n\t    Preacher Hammer Curls - 3x10 - 25\n\t    Machine Curls - 3x10 - 100\n\tSitups and Planks\n\nThis will be the Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule.  On Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday I hope to do a lighter version of this as an off day schedule.  Each major muscle group will only be worked 1 or 2 times per week.\n\n### Recording\n\nI will be recording my weight in the mornings, daily.  I will keep track of my exercise weights more loosely.\n\n## Goals\n\nMost of the fitness literature, DVDs, and routines is bullshit.  Personal trainers, gyms and other things often have alternate goals, mostly including money and lack of injury.  They don't operate in your **fiduciary** interest.  I will be ignoring almost all of it.\n\nI have 3 weight goals and 3 strength goals.\n\nWeight Goals:\n\tBack to 240, my \"normal\" weight for the past ten years.  This should not take more than 3-4 weeks.\n\t230.  I haven't weighed this since not long after college.  8-12 weeks.\n\t220.  This is a reasonable and maintainable weight for someone of my build.  This is the ultimate goal.  \n\tIf I get lower than this, then it's a bonus.  16-20 weeks.\n\nStrength Goals:\n\tSquat 1.5x bodyweight.  At 225, that's 340.  I can currently rep 275 for 10 pretty easily.\n\tBench Press 1.5x bodyweight.  At 225, that's 340.  This will be the most difficult.  My all time max is 325.\n\tDeadlift 2x bodyweight.  At 225, that's 450.  I could likely do 405 currently, although I'm reluctant to\n\tbecause of a poor lower back history.  I'm the most reluctant to push this one.\n\n## Reasoning\n\nOne thing I've noticed is that most of working out and diet are completely psychological.  I've set this up to maximize the probability of success for me.  \n\n### Do What You Love\n\nI love lifting heavy things.  I'm pretty good at it.  I hate (**hate**) running.  And I'm not good at it.  If I work hard at doing something I enjoy, I'll do it more and enjoy it more.  This shouldn't be something you hate doing.  If you love running, this probably won't be for you.\n\n### Enjoy Food\n\nI enjoy food, like, a lot.  Pizza is my favorite thing ever.  I picked this diet, not because it's the most effective (although that may be true), but because I still get to eat all the shitty food I love.  On Saturday's, Five Guys, beer, pizza, bagels, and anything else are all on the table.  That's enough motivation to keep going on those dreary Wednesdays when you just want some sugar.\n\n### Keeping records makes it real.\n\nKeeping a daily record of my weight is important.  It directs my efforts as being *intentional*.  I don't actually expect to lose weight each day.  There will be plateaus and, after cheat days, my weight will definitely increase.  The point of recording it daily is to keep the process front and center.  You can't avoid it and you can't put it on the backburner.  If it's the first thing you do everyday, it's naturally one of the most important things you do.\n\n## So Here We Go\n\nI hope to keep track here on semi-regular basis.  Until then, I'm looking forward to tomorrow!  Who's with me?!\n\n","html":"<p>I'm starting a new workout and diet regimen tomorrow.

I'm spending about 75 minutes going hard, three times a week.  Weights for every major body part are up.

It gets you through the week to know that Saturday you can still have all that crap.\n\n#### The Day After Cheat Day Sucks\n\nYour stomach always grumbles the next day.\n\n#### Food Is Not The Problem.  Gratification Is.\n\nThe most surprising thing has been that I don't usually miss most of the crap I used to eat.  What I miss is the chance to get a break from work at lunch, or the spontaneity of grabbing a burger on the way home.  The lifestyle of food has proved to be a much more dynamic factor in this than I expected.  I haven't figured out quite what this means yet, but it's definitely on my mind.\n\n#### Onward\n\nI'll do another check-in sometime soon.

I could still stand to lose a few more, but I have a plan..\n\nWhat I started to realize is that my body composition has been changing for the better, and once my winter weightbelt left me, I decided to switch to a more \"traditional\" build and cut plan, as they do in bodybuilding.\n\nBodybuilders generally have two major phases.  First they bulk up, then they cut down.  They spend a cycle of weeks (duration varies) focusing on building muscle mass and strength, irrespective of fat and looks.  This isn't to say they don't care, because they still typically eat very well and don't get fat, it's just secondary to the focus of adding good, lean muscle.  Once this has been achieved (or at a pre-ordained date, based on something like a contest), they will refocus their diet and cardio to cut bodyfat so they can show off their insane striations.\n\nNow.. I'm not exactly trying to hit a contest weight like some of those guys, but I do want to look good this summer.. so that's my timeline.  Early June is when I want to hit a nice stride, and I'll plan out an 8-week cut phase from there.  Which means right now I'm focused on building muscle.\n\nSo how am I doing?  Back in mid-December, I was struggling with 3 full sets of 225 on squats.  I could do 315 on deadlift a couple of times, but my back was dead for the rest of the workout.  I could do 225 maybe twice on bench (and I was really unhappy with that).\n\nThis past week I had some fun with more weight.  I usually do at least 2 sets of squats with 315 now for 6-8 reps.  I'd like to strap on a belt and see about going north of 350 on squat, but I worry about my back, so I haven't gone there yet.  I had 7 sets of deadlift last weekend, the last 3 of which were 375x2, 275x10 and 225x15.  For the same reason (back), I'm still nervous going north of 400 on deadlift.  And I'm doing 8-10 reps of 225 on bench right now.  I'm not as strong on bench as last year, but I'm on a good upward curve.\n\nThe great thing about all these is that they're set numbers, so I'm doing a bunch more exercises after these too.\n\nI've got a few more weeks to focus on strength, and then I'll start my cut regimen.  I haven't figured out yet exactly how that's going to go, but I know it will be hard.  I enjoy strength and heavy weights much more than lettuce and fasted cardio.\n\nI'm expecting to start the cut phase right around 240, so even while I'm adding muscle, I still expect to drop a bit more.  During the cut phase?  Who knows.. I lost 12+ in 4 weeks pretty easily in January.  That doesn't seem unrealistic.  So by early-June, sub-230 and looking good seems like a reasonable goal.\n\nWe'll see what happens, now get your ass to the gym! :)\n","html":"<p>Last Wednesday was two months from my starting point, where I weighed 258.

I can understand that to some extent, I like good wine.  But a snob I am not, at least not in the way my friends think I am.\n\n### Some History\n\nWine has a long history that has changed drastically in the 20th century, and it all started with an insect.  At the end of the 19th century, phyloxxera ravaged most vineyards around the world, and almost all wines had to graft new plants that could deal with phyloxxera.  Some people believe that pre-phyloxxera wines had a different, richer character.  A few very small vineyards in Europe escaped phylloxera altogether, and their wines today [command huge prices](http://www.wine-searcher.com/wine-5284-1963-quinta-do-noval-nacional-vintage-port-portugal).\n\nAfter phyloxxera, for more complex reasons, vintages became more and more important to track as well.  Christie's was the first auction house that started trading in wine heavily, and they tracked their vintages as an additional way to track prices.  They would find caches of older wines or particularly prized vintages and sell the collections in London.  Michael Broadbent (who, incidentally, is my own favorite wine writer) would publish tasting notes on the collection, with a guide of 1 through 5 stars.  This was the first time that auction prices for wines started to rise to more stratospheric levels.  Certainly, Chateau Latour was expensive before this happened - as it should be as a First Growth Bordeaux - but the notoriety and fame of these vineyards skyrocketed.\n\nBut the biggest change happened in the late 1970s, when a Maryland lawyer named Robert Parker started publishing his own tasting notes in *The Wine Advocate*.  The big change?  He rated his wines on a 100-point scale.  That small, innocuous addition has changed the entire wine industry.  Enter almost any wine store today and you'll see featured 90 and 91 point wines for cheap.  Finding a 95 point wine for under $50 is pretty much impossible, and most are far more than that.  The difference between an 89 and 90 point review can mean huge differences in sales and profits for a winery.  \n\nSo what's the problem?  The problem is that the system is bunk.  Parker himself says:\n\n\tScores, however, do not reveal the important facts about a wine. \n    The written commentary that accompanies the ratings is a \n    better source of information regarding the wine's style and \n    personality, its relative quality vis-à-vis its peers, and its\n    value and aging potential than any score could ever indicate.\n\nThat doesn't stop him from assigning a number value though.  It allows people to make a lazy decision when they walk the seemingly endless aisles of verbose and complicated wine choices.  \n\nIt's worse than that though.  On any given day, how will a wine expert rate a particular bottle?  Would it be the same tomorrow?  Would all the other bottles from that vintage be the same?  Would the same expert rate the bottle the same way on a second taste?\n\nTests have been done on this subject, and the evidence is not good.  Tasters will pay attention to price, the type and elegance of the bottle, and color to make poor assumptions.  [The Brochet tests](http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2007/11/02/the-subjectivity-of-wine/) are particularly damning.  When served identical wines in different bottles, experts picked the bigger, fancier bottle.  When served two glasses of identical white wine, one glass with red food coloring, the tasters noted wild differences between the two glasses.\n\nAnd these are experts.  How do they expect the laity to fare when browsing hundreds of selections looking for a bottle of red for a nice dinner at home?  The 100 point system, whatever else it is, must be seen as particularly convenient.\n\n### The First Kind of Wine - Delicious\n\nIn fact, after thinking things through, this type of system is perhaps a good thing for the first kind of wine: everyday wine.  The primary property of an everyday wine is that it is delicious.  An everyday wine is a robust, well-made wine with interesting character.  Type, varietal, geography, brand, etc. don't matter at all, except perhaps for your particular tastes; if you enjoy a nice deep red vs. a lighter white.\n\nBut let me back up first, as I fear I've made a bit of a jump here.  **Why** doesn't any of this matter?  Mostly because all of these specifics that have become built up and made into wine snobbery are not actually all that relevant.  See, the purpose of a good wine is to facilitate a good time, whether that good time is a celebration, a wonderful dinner with friends, a conversation by the fire, or the signing of an important document like the Declaration of Independence (the Founders toasted the Declaration with bottles of Madeira).  Wine is important to any and all of these occasions.  Wine can enhance these occasions and make them even better. \n\nAnd so wine should be delicious.  Everything else - the specifics of how a wine is delicious, the culture of it - those can all add to the experience, but they don't matter if the wine is not delicious.  For some people, wine is so delicious that an occasion can be made simply out of opening a bottle.  But that's not everybody.\n\nWhen everyday wine is delicious, it becomes a great part of whatever good time you are having.  Nearly any wine that sits in a store with a score is good enough for this category.  So the scoring system actually does some good, in that it allows you to easily avoid having wine that is not delicious.  But that's it.\n\n### The Special Occasion Wine\n\nNow that we have a working definition for the purpose of wine, it extends naturally to the second kind of wine: The Special Occasion.\n\nThis one gets a bit more interesting, mostly because I think it's less predictable than most people expect.  Typically, we think of a Special Occasion wine as the one we get for Thanksgiving.  While we hope that's true, I think a wine can take us by surprise more often than we expect.  Special Occasion wines, for me, usually end up being beautiful summer evening dinners with my wife, or impromptu conversations with good friends.  \n\nIt's important to note that there are Special Occasions and Special Occasion wines.  We'd like them to always line up, but they don't.  Some wines can make lazy Wednesdays into Special Occasions.  Or, if you're lucky enough to have that wine for Christmas dinner, they can enhance an evening and make it one to remember for years.  Other wines will remain simply delicious no matter how hopeful you are, and never transcend into this second kind of wine.\n\nThat's what this is really about anyway: transcendence.   Wine is an ethereal, fleeting, joyful part of life.  We never know exactly how or when it will happen, or even if it will happen, but when a bottle makes that transition, it's almost holy.  There's a reason Christianity around the world memorializes the Last Supper with bread and wine.\n\n### The Magical Wine\n\nThe pinnacle of this experience can be magical.  I have been fortunate enough to have a few of these experiences.  They are rare.  The one I always think of is a bottle of 1976 Lopez de Heredia Rioja sitting on the wood floor of my friend Andrew's empty new house a few weeks before his marriage.  Pat, Andrew, and I sat there for 2 or 3 hours with that one bottle, and time stood still.\n\nAnother was a bottle of Orin Swift's Mercury Head, shared with my wife in our new house with our new sleeping daughter upstairs.  Another was a [3 oz. pour of 1912 Madeira with my friend Katie](http://www.infiniteabyss.org/2009/01/10/customerservice.html) around Christmas.  There are a couple others with my parents and friends where I don't even remember the specific wine.  But it was amazing.\n\nI said before that Michael Broadbent is my favorite wine writer.  His attitude towards wine captures this magic.  He recognizes there is an ethereal component to wine that is not in any way rational.  In his compiled tasting notes, [Vintage Wine](http://www.amazon.com/Michael-Broadbents-Vintage-Wine-Broadbent/dp/B005ZOFP3I), he uses a 5 star system, but there's a few very special notes in his book where he gives a wine 6 stars.  In one 6 star review of an old Tokaji, he says, \"..my wife and I sat up in bed, glasses in hand, on 31 December 1972, to see in the New Year.\"  At least as important as the wine was the company, the occasion, and the experience.\n\nEven Robert Parker agrees:\n\n\t\"I really think probably the only difference between a \n    96-, 97-, 98-, 99-, and 100-point wine is really the emotion\n    of the moment.\" --Parker\n\nMagical Bottles don't have to be expensive.  They don't have to be special.  Buying a special or expensive bottle of wine is a way by which to increase the probability that you will have a Special Occasion or a little piece of magic.  But it's not a guarantee.  On any given day, a $12 bottle might do it where a $200 bottle won't.\n\n### Pricing\n\nAn interesting corollary to this perspective on wine is that price is frequently signaling for something else.  Sometimes it's income level or expectation.  But preferably it maps to your desire for a particularly special occasion.\n\nFor me, this means that most wines I buy are in the $6-15 range.  There are tons of delicious wines that can be had in this price range, including reds.  Shy away from the popular Pinots and Cabs where the market has inflated the prices.  One of my favorites right now is a Sicilian red that I get for $6/bottle by the case.\n\nStart creeping up towards $20-40 and you will find many Special Occasion wines.  Any price over $50, you're typically either buying branding, location, or history.  This may be perfectly legitimate, but it's something to remember.\n\nI've got a few go-to bottles now that I get frequently, hoping they will stand up to the test of a Special Occasion.  I love Orin Swift and Sea Smoke Pinots.  Chateauneuf-du-Pape and Caymus Conundrum are consistently wonderful.\n\nThese and many others are delicious.  They can be great for a Special Occasion.  Not always, but when they are, it's grand.  And if not, the wine will still be delicious.\n\nAnd every once in awhile, the stars align, the mood is perfect, the company thrilling, the conversation compelling, and the wine can be magic.\n\n\n\n\n\n","html":"<p>A bunch of my friends think of me as a wine snob.  I can understand that to some extent, I like good wine.  But a snob I am not, at least not in the way my friends think I am.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"somehistory\">Some History</h3>\n\n<p>Wine has a long history that has changed drastically in the 20th century, and it all started with an insect.  At the end of the 19th century, phyloxxera ravaged most vineyards around the world, and almost all wines had to graft new plants that could deal with phyloxxera.  Some people believe that pre-phyloxxera wines had a different, richer character.  A few very small vineyards in Europe escaped phylloxera altogether, and their wines today <a href=\"http://www.wine-searcher.com/wine-5284-1963-quinta-do-noval-nacional-vintage-port-portugal\">command huge prices</a>.</p>\n\n<p>After phyloxxera, for more complex reasons, vintages became more and more important to track as well.  Christie's was the first auction house that started trading in wine heavily, and they tracked their vintages as an additional way to track prices.  They would find caches of older wines or particularly prized vintages and sell the collections in London.  Michael Broadbent (who, incidentally, is my own favorite wine writer) would publish tasting notes on the collection, with a guide of 1 through 5 stars.  This was the first time that auction prices for wines started to rise to more stratospheric levels.  Certainly, Chateau Latour was expensive before this happened - as it should be as a First Growth Bordeaux - but the notoriety and fame of these vineyards skyrocketed.</p>\n\n<p>But the biggest change happened in the late 1970s, when a Maryland lawyer named Robert Parker started publishing his own tasting notes in <em>The Wine Advocate</em>.  The big change?  He rated his wines on a 100-point scale.  That small, innocuous addition has changed the entire wine industry.  Enter almost any wine store today and you'll see featured 90 and 91 point wines for cheap.  Finding a 95 point wine for under $50 is pretty much impossible, and most are far more than that.  The difference between an 89 and 90 point review can mean huge differences in sales and profits for a winery.  </p>\n\n<p>So what's the problem?  The problem is that the system is bunk.  Parker himself says:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Scores, however, do not reveal the important facts about a wine. \nThe written commentary that accompanies the ratings is a \nbetter source of information regarding the wine's style and \npersonality, its relative quality vis-à-vis its peers, and its\nvalue and aging potential than any score could ever indicate.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That doesn't stop him from assigning a number value though.  It allows people to make a lazy decision when they walk the seemingly endless aisles of verbose and complicated wine choices.  </p>\n\n<p>It's worse than that though.  On any given day, how will a wine expert rate a particular bottle?  Would it be the same tomorrow?  Would all the other bottles from that vintage be the same?  Would the same expert rate the bottle the same way on a second taste?</p>\n\n<p>Tests have been done on this subject, and the evidence is not good.  Tasters will pay attention to price, the type and elegance of the bottle, and color to make poor assumptions.  <a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2007/11/02/the-subjectivity-of-wine/\">The Brochet tests</a> are particularly damning.

Most of them don't know it.  It's really hard to measure something like that.  Heck, there's a lot of obese people that somehow don't know it too, and that's easy to measure.  \n\nIn an effort to quantify what it means to be a bad driver, I've provided what I believe to be two clear symptoms.  These are highly generalized insofar as most specific cases of bad driving dilute down to these.\n\nFor some reason when everyone get's behind the wheel, they suddenly think they're always right and the other guy is a blithering idiot.  So it's worth noting that even good drivers will fall prey to either situation on occasion.  Evaluating against these criteria are also a great way to tell if you're in the wrong in a given situation.\n\n### If you're surprised often on the road   \nI don't mean by this that once a year you're amazed when a bike flies by you at 110 mph.  If you're surprised often by something, on a regular basis, you might be a bad driver.  As a general rule, all of the good drivers on the road are extremely aware of their surroundings.  They'll see that car edging out of the side street and considering jumping in front of them.  They'll see the guy coming up behind them at speed.  They'll know that the girl two lanes over is looking over her shoulder and planning to switch lanes.  \n\nKnowing your surroundings means knowing what's happening ahead of you, on your sides, and behind you.  If you are surprised when someone turns a blinker on, or changes lanes, or moves past you at a reasonable speed delta.. you should be paying more attention.  If you suddenly hear a honk because you started moving towards that gap you thought was there that isn't really.. you should be paying more attention.\n\n*Corollary*: If you hesitate a lot.  For example, when switching lanes.\n<br>*Corollary*: If you're on your phone.  I'm not religious about this like some are, I use my phone at traffic lights.  But it's a slippery slope.\n*Corollary* - If you have no idea how your car's ABS works or what the limit of grip from your tires feels like.  To be fair, this may not be your fault.  For some reason, our driving schools and license requirements require no practice in situations of stress or accident prevention.  This means that, for most people, the first time they feel the ABS kick in or hear the tires squeal they're already in a bad situation and are freaking out.  We need better education.\n*Corollary* - Premature optimization.  I see this all the time.  There will be two left hand turn lanes and one lane is empty while the other is backed up ten cars deep.  Awareness also means understanding where you're going and how traffic around you is flowing on your route.\n\n### You create large speed deltas compared to the flow of traffic\n \nThis symptom speaks to at least one of two things.  The first is arrogance.  It portrays the following viewpoint: \"I know better than everyone else and they should all drive like me.\"  Hopefully that thought doesn't feel familiar.\n\nFar more insidious is a lack of knowledge.  It could mean you have a lack of knowledge of the rules of the road.  As a consequence, it means you don't understand the real problem.  This is probably not your fault, as the government bodies designed to teach you such things perform abysmally.  The assumption they make is that high speeds are bad.  This is absolutely false.  It just requires a very basic, simple set of rules to follow, and everything would work just fine.  Unfortunately, those rules are almost universally disregarded.  Differences of 10-15 mph aren't large.  It would be easy for a four lane highway to have a very safe gradient from 55 up to 90+ if we just followed rules across the lanes of traffic.  \n\nInterestingly, an equivalently false statement you'll hear is that speed kills.  That isn't true - if you're traveling at speed the default state is to maintain that speed.  Drastic changes in speed kill.  For example,  changing very rapidly from 80 mph to 0 mph won't be pleasant.   Less extreme examples of that are generally what cause accidents - one car doing 80 and another doing 50 or one car stopped at 0 and a car behind it hitting at 10.  If you know what the real problem is - then you can develop a set of rules to provide for that problem.  If you think the problem is that speed kills, then you get stuck with byzantine rules like 55 mph speed limits.\n\n*Corollary* - If you're a punk that enjoys racing on the highway through traffic.  I wish there were a highway in the US like the Autobahn that allowed 100+ mph speeds.  But while the flow of traffic is generally 65-80 mph, doing 100 is stupid.\n<br>*Corollary* - If you're a slow driver that sits below the speed limit, e.g. that Camry going 40 mph trying to merge onto a freeway with 70 mph traffic.. and then STAYING at 40 mph.  Dangerous.<br>*Corollary* - If you think everyone slower than you is an idiot, and everyone faster than you has a death wish.\n*Corollary* - If you think it's fine to drive in the left lane during rain storms.  Sorry, still the fast lane.\n<br>*Corollary* - If you think troopers are your best protection.  You've all seen the bumper stickers that say this.  It's junk.  YOU (or your driver) are your best protection.  A trooper is not.  There are circumstances when troopers come in very handy, and we should all have huge respect for the civic importance of police and the men and women who admirably perform that duty.  But in everyday driving, they have very little to do with you.  And that's the way it should be.\n\nTravel in (parts of) Europe a bit and you'll notice two interesting things.  First, that everyone follows certain rules.  For instance, passing on the left (or right, on the British Isles).  The equivalent is that if you're not going that fast, you stay on the right (or left).  And second, you'll see very few cops.  The only time I've ever seen cops on the road while *not* in a city is when passing an accident.  That's it.  Their function is to protect, not as an additional tax revenue source.  They have cameras for that.\n \nIf we accept that the real problem is speed deltas, we've done lots of things very stupidly when designing our road system.  Exit/Entry lanes for highways should provide proper merge lengths.  Exit/Entry lanes should only ever merge onto the slow lanes, not onto the fast lane.  Cloverleafs are typically decreasing radius, slowing you down the most right before you merge.  They should allow for acceleration up to speed onto a highway, rather than diminishing it.  \n\nWe've got a huge infrastructure project to update our roads over the next twenty years, we'll fix it then right?\n","html":"<p>There's a lot of bad drivers out there.

But in everyday driving, they have very little to do with you.  And that's the way it should be.</p>\n\n<p>Travel in (parts of) Europe a bit and you'll notice two interesting things.  First, that everyone follows certain rules.  For instance, passing on the left (or right, on the British Isles).  The equivalent is that if you're not going that fast, you stay on the right (or left).  And second, you'll see very few cops.  The only time I've ever seen cops on the road while <em>not</em> in a city is when passing an accident.  That's it.  Their function is to protect, not as an additional tax revenue source.  They have cameras for that.</p>\n\n<p>If we accept that the real problem is speed deltas, we've done lots of things very stupidly when designing our road system.  Exit/Entry lanes for highways should provide proper merge lengths.  Exit/Entry lanes should only ever merge onto the slow lanes, not onto the fast lane.  Cloverleafs are typically decreasing radius, slowing you down the most right before you merge.  They should allow for acceleration up to speed onto a highway, rather than diminishing it.  </p>\n\n<p>We've got a huge infrastructure project to update our roads over the next twenty years, we'll fix it then right?</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2014-06-29T20:17:51.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2017-03-12T15:52:54.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2017-03-12T15:52:54.000Z","published_by":1,"visibility":"public","mobiledoc":null,"amp":null},{"id":85,"uuid":"66b787ac-7aab-48b1-940b-4b1c974bbf3b","title":"Car Washes and Girl Scout Cookies","slug":"car-washes-and-girl-scouts","markdown":"I'm going to talk about some traditions we have with our kids in a rather stern way, so if you're easily offended, feel free to leave now.\n\n### Giving Kids Direction\n\nFundraising car washes suck.  Girl Scout Cookies suck too, but for different reasons.  \n\nThese and similar activities are pretty common these days, and are often considered service activities for kids.  They are considered a means for children to learn how to do some good in the world and to take some ownership over a task.  Sound right?\n\nSounds wrong.\n\nWhat they actually do is suck out the innate drive that kids have to help themselves and others.  They drive kids to get ready for the modern working world: 40 hours a week and a boss.  They teach you to do your two pence of work for your shilling and go home.  You know, a fair wage for fair work. \n\n(Fair work: I hope you don't consider a bunch of suds in a bucket or a box of pre-wrapped cookies as the only viable work our kids can do.  Shows what we think of them, doesn't it?  Do you think they don't get the message we're accidentally teaching them?  They do, for sure.)\n\nTo some, this might sound just fine.  After all, most adults do this very thing and probably haven't given it much thought since they were in their early twenties.  Our early twenties are a time ripe with opportunity.  We feel just old enough to do something interesting, but young enough to be filled with exuberant energy - a resource we don't want to squander.  We forget that the choice of a regular working career can be a decision made for dreams: usually the dream of a house and a family.  \n\nTo make these decisions well, our kids and teenagers need to have decent concepts of work, ability, and service.  Our culture needs to have a serious discussion about childhood, adolescence, and how we expect our kids to grow up. Both of my examples - car washes and girl scout cookies - point towards this discussion in two different ways.  We'll take them one at a time.\n\n\n### Skills\n\nI'm sure you've all seen the crazy teenage car wash at your local gas station.  You might have even let them spray down your car for a nice little donation.  While it sounds like you're helping, I think you're actually hurting.  And the adults that let the kids organizae the car wash are hurting more.  \n\nHere's the thing: car washes typically fund an activity or a trip.  Too often they seem to be cheerleading trips, but I'm sure there are plenty of others.  Adults have a lot of well-meaning but rather poor logic driving the idea of kids (partially) self-funding these trips.  Thins like\n\n* The kids will take it more seriously because they had to work towards it.  \n* They'll learn that sometimes you have to do something tedious to do something you want.  \n* It gives them valuable time management skills for when they have a job.  \n\nAny of these reasons alone make my skin crawl, but I don't think they're the *actual* logic adults have in mind.\n\nI think the real reason parents make kids help fund a trip is usually because the activity being funded is a waste of time and money that the parents don't really want to pay for.  It can be a waste time if either the activity itself isn't very valuable or the kids aren't very good.  \n\nThat's not a politically correct thing to say, so it rarely gets said.  But I think we can rely on proof by counter-example to show it's true.\n\n#### Value\n\nLet's say my kid is working on some really awesome skill and needs some money to further it.  For example:\n\n- Painting, and she's invited to exhibit her work, but needs money/help mounting and preparing it\n- Programming a webapp, and she needs $40/month to deploy to a hosting environment\n- Piano, violin, or some other instrument, and she's been invited to play at an out-of-state recital\n\nWhen the time comes for any of these, I'm not going to make her go wash cars for two Saturdays.  The idea sounds kind of ridiculous.  She's already incredibly busy and motivated to work on the skill itself, be it art, programming or music.  So why would I take her away from working on the skill -  the important thing?  I won't.  Instead, I'm just going to **GIVE HER THE MONEY**, so she can be busy continuing to learn the great skills she's interested in.\n\nIf the skills the kids are learning are really that important or interesting, they should just focus on the skills instead of dealing with mindless car washing?  All the car wash does is take them away from the good stuff.\n\n#### Fun\n\nOf course, most carwashes aren't used to fund the next Picasso, Zuckerburg, or Joshua Bell.  Usually, the activities aren't that valuable or the kids aren't savants.\n\nAnd you know what?  That's totally OK.  Part of childhood is having an absolute blast with your friends or family.  It's about making mistakes on a stage or learning what it's like to be on a team.\n\nSo, God forbid, if one of my children ends up being a mediocre cheerleader, I'm still just going to **GIVE HER THE MONEY**, because I love her and she's just a kid that wants to have camaraderie and be with her friends.  And that's ok, because she's a kid.  \n\nOf course, the school or some other organization might end up organizing the car wash, with or without my donation.  Would I be OK with her participating?\n\nNot really.  It's not just that I think this kind of fundraising is unnecessary.  It's that it can be subtly and implicitly harmful.  My kid doesn't need some faux-economic lesson about earning your own way through trading your time for money.  And it's not just trading your time for money, it's trading your time for money in a really shitty, menial way with a really shitty return on investment.  Can you imagine an activity with a lower profit margin per man-hour than a group car wash?\n\nThere's also a difference between a fundraising car wash and an actual job that a kid might get, for instance over summer break.  In the case of the summer job, there's no \"higher purpose\" for which to strive.  It's just a job.  But a carwash is for some higher purpose (however derivative), and so  implies a lesson in translating tedium into passion, both indirectly and incorrectly.  A summer job is a simpler equation, and I'd be fine with my children taking the time to make some money.  I'll hope they can use a real skill they might be developing at that job, but they'll still learn a lot, not the least of which would be that keeping to someone else's schedule sucks.\n\nBottom line, if you want to teach your kid a lesson in economics, don't teach them that the best skill someone is willing to pay them for is remedial work with the lowest possible time-to-profit equation imaginable.  We teach them this because it's what most adults do - we trade our time for money.  The difference is that most adults have some higher level of skill that allows them to \"earn a living\".\n\nI don't want my children learning this.  I don't want them thinking about money as \"earning a living\"  I don't want them to think about a job as an even trade of time for money.  I want them unhindered by such perspective when they enter the exuberant years of early adulthood, so that they have a full array of paths exposed in front of them.\n\nMy kids may end up dedicating their lives to the service of others through a non-profit or a vow of poverty in the Church.  They may learn how to maximize the profits of a large corporation, or develop a new product that's valuable to millions or billions.  They may just get a job, hopefully one they enjoy, and raise a wonderful family.  But to properly understand their choices and to be ready for any of these, they need a paradigm of money, value, skill, and time that is, unfortunately, absent from the construct of the typical middle-class employed adult of today, through either amnesia or ignorance.\n\n#### Need\n\nOf course, I've sidestepped one huge and legitimate reason for crazy fundraising activities: Need.  It's entirely possible that the money just isn't there.  What then?\n\nIn this case, I at least understand why groups would go to any length to acquire the necessary resources.  But I'd still rather just **GIVE THEM THE MONEY**.  I don't need a car wash, or cookies, or pizzas as a return.  Whether it's for value or fun, it's worth it.\n\nGrandparents, Aunts, Uncles, friends, neighbors.. lots of people - they'd all chip in.  The only group you won't hit is all of the strangers out there, admittedly a large group.  It strikes me as I write this though, that more organizations that actually have a need should use Kickstarter or something similar to raise the money.  If the goal amount is reasonable, and it usually is, you can probably reach the goal without wasting time on a silly fundraising activity with a horrible return on investment and a nasty, misleading economic lesson.  \n\n### Service\n\nLOOk tHEM IN THE FACE.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, one can argue that cheerleading is not nearly as important as somethign productive.. say learning how to write, or how to program, how to do somethign creative, how to paint, or how to do science.  That's true, cheerleading is not as important.  I think deep down we know that, so we make our kids pay for it instead.\n\nIt would seem really ridiculous to make a student learnign to paint raise money in some stupid way to travel to an exhibit to show his portfolio.  It just sounds stupid being written out.\n\nWe're at this weird point with our children where there are traditional activities they do to add to their classroom learning.  You know, service oriented stuff.  In my day we had to sell magazines or pizzas.  Why?  \n\nThe worst is girl scout cookies.  What money does that raise aside from allowing the group to organize enough to sell girl scout cookies again the next year?  Also, girl scout cookies are so damn good.  So people will buy them irrespective of the value the org will net.  That's a shitty thing to do\n\nIf it's for service, is sitting out in front of a grocery store for hours selling a box here or there really what we want to teach our kids that service means?  I certainly don't..\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_globally,_act_locally","html":"<p>I'm going to talk about some traditions we have with our kids in a rather stern way, so if you're easily offended, feel free to leave now.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"givingkidsdirection\">Giving Kids Direction</h3>\n\n<p>Fundraising car washes suck.

The first is to (eventually) produce more PhD's to feed back into the system, usually driven to continue to do research in their field.  But research is a relatively loose term at colleges today.  Often it means that the professor is working on some theory with direct application to a field.  Many professors are starting companies to continue their labors, especially on the STEM side.  The association with economic or industry applications is direct even at the post-doc level.\n\nThe places where pure, unapplied research occurs are perhaps less common now than they used to be, at least as compared to the whole of research, and more constrained.  Mathematics is one example.  Specialized mathematics can be hard to place in application for decades or even centuries.\n\nSo we can ask: what is research and who does it?  What is the responsibility of a professor - teacher, researcher, or both?  How does the title of \"professor\" differ from \"academician\"?  Is rate of output the primary measure that leads to tenure?  Why?  Where do the truly revolutionary ideas come from in the modern era?  Are they supposed to come from professors or research?  Does it even make sense to ask where these ideas come from?\n\nAt first, the struggle between teaching, research and publication struck me as a negative trend, and I felt somewhat uncomfortable about today's crop of professors.  But I've changed tack.  The \"Equal-Odds\" rule suggests that people in a given field have equal odds to produce the Next Big Thing as they do to produce a ton of cruft.  In other words, you have to be prolific and willing to produce a lot of crap to also produce something amazing.  In addition, focusing on hard research problems is [sailing upwind](http://paulgraham.com/hs.html) - to use Paul Graham's nomenclature - to the problem of tenure.  Tenure is a [trivial problem](http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2007/07/17/understanding_engineers_feasibility/), insofar as there is a well-formed (though difficult) solution to achieving it.  Solving or producing work on hard (non-trivial) problems is more difficult than receiving tenure.  \n\nInterestingly, some of the most amazing human thought in recent decades - regardless of direct application - has come from pure research.  I'm thinking especially of Princeton's IAS and [Xerox's PARC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)#Legacy), but there are many others as well.  In the case of IAS, many fields have been furthered in a phenomenal way with minimal attachment to funding, political stance, or today's issues.  In the case of PARC, a lot of IT and CS innovation was developed in one complex in the 60s and 70s.  Other examples exist too.  The [laser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser#History) was first described as a solution without a problem.\n\nAside from the PhD and research recycling process, the second far more common purpose for college is to produce reasonably skilled workers for the commercial-industrial-political complex.  Widespread secondary education only started with the industrial revolution, and the continued forward economic progress of the world has only increased the desired skill level for the average worker.\n\nResearch is definitely correlated to the power and purpose of higher education.  Understanding the desire to produce relatively skilled workers feels like a key to the connection.  Perhaps the industrial and technological advances of the last couple hundred years have closed the gap between what used to be the abstract fields of academics and the more everyday applications of real life?  Perhaps the graduating senior is only so different from the new PhD as a matter of degree?\n\n{something here}\n\nBut what does that mean for how we think of colleges?  Has our cultural template for college kept up with the changes?\n\n### Prestige\n\nNow I feel a bit weird talking about college prestige.  Two people in my life are closely tied to recruiting and marketing for two different colleges.  So with that in mind, I want to be specific.  Choosing a college, if you go to college, is very important.  It will effect your outlook on the world in a profound way and it can be some of the best years of your life.  Choosing wisely to make the most of your life is important, but the definition of \"choosing wisely\" probably has a different set of criteria than most people think.\n\nOne of those wrong criteria is often prestige.  Don't be fooled by prestige.  The question of prestige is a much different one than which college will provide you the best (learning) experience.  Prestige is a combination of branding, honor, history, and, only minimally, rigor.  Once you're out of college, where you went to college is virtually meaningless in most cases.  There isn't a long gradient of prestige, with lots of colleges and universities spread all over the gradient.  I think this is what most colleges try to make you think.  \n\nAs far as prestige, there are in fact four types.  Here they are:\n\n  * Harvard.  Look, if you get into Harvard, you ought to go.  The complete short list is Harvard, Yale, Princeton.  MIT and Caltech are the tech equivalent.  Oxford and Cambridge on the other side of the pond.\n\n    Why is this true?  When Harvard existed in the 18th century, who went there?  General education in the same form as today didn't exist then for a very good reason: most people didn't *need* it.  It wasn't something they would use to make money and to support themselves.  Jobs didn't ask for their major.  Then the industrial revolution hit, and suddenly everything changed.  But the original purpose of the Harvard's, the Yale's, the Cologne's.. they were for the most creative and brilliant (and rich) people to pursue the most creative arts in the world and for the most scientifically proficient to pursue the most scientific.  It wasn't education the same way that college is now.  And it still isn't in some sense.  Additionally, the mean caliber of people that attend is incredibly high.  Going to school at Harvard means you're constantly attending class with future CEOs, heads of state, billionaires and politicians.  You'll never be in a better place to build a network of friends and influence.\n\n  * Exceptional colleges.  This is the rest of the Ivy League schools, Stanford, Washington University in St. Louis, University of Virginia, University of Chicago, Duke, maybe a handful of others.\n\n  * Specific prestige for specific departments: Wharton School of Business, very high ranking tech departments.  \n\n  * Everything else.  Sorry, that's just the way it is.  There's no difference between Western State University and Typical College.\n\nThis is not a justification for going to any of these schools.  An experience at Typical College may in fact be far better than lots of other schools.  You might meet your spouse there.  And there's nothing here about educational standards or finances.  In fact there's nothing here about anything except prestige.   Prestige is one of the prime marketing tools for colleges.  But the hype about prestige is largely irrelevant, especially when it comes to getting a job after college.  In the rare cases it is relevant, you already know the college name (Harvard) and they don't need to market much.\n\nA lot of colleges might disagree with this.  *You* might disagree with it, and that's a testament to how well colleges market prestige, because what I'm actually advocating is that it doesn't matter at all.  They'll tell you that it matters where you go, that their English department is better than other schools of a similar size or price.  Their swimming pools are bigger, the dorms are better, the computer labs are more complete.\n\nNo.  For the core competency of any college - that is to say *learning* - none of that matters at all.  I heard the provost of some university or other on NPR awhile ago say (paraphrasing) \"but we're an academic institution.  Teaching is what we do.\"  That's a big difference from a statement like \"Learning is what we do\".  You can teach to a completely passive audience. \n\n### Idle and Idyll\n\nWhich is why none of these things really matter.  A good professor can enhance and encourage the learning of their interested students, but not their disinterested students.  On the other hand, a student can still learn in spite of a bad professor.  Even when there are good professors, interested in teaching, how often are the grades and classes based off the grad student TAs instead?\n\nA good student can learn anywhere.  They can learn in a great class or a bad class.  They can learn in class or outside of class.  They can learn in school or outside of school.  \n\nHarvard may have exceptional facilities and great professors, but they also have more inquisitive, curious and interested students per capita than other schools too.\n\nThe sad thing about this is that we've deluded ourselves as a culture into believing that college is a mandatory requirement for everything.  A continued 4 years of teaching - or perhaps training - is required after high school before entering nearly any field.  \n\nI should specify that adults think this is true.  College students think something else.  They see college as a time of learning, which is a far better perspective than the adults have.  Unfortunately, college students (including me at the time) think most of their learning is outside the classroom.  It's a time to learn how to live, how to schedule days, how to have fun, hopefully how to begin shouldering a bit of responsibility.  But more often, it seems to be a continuation of the social press of high school with a wider reach.\n\nGiven a college life of actively shunning many responsibilities, of partying and drinking, it seems unsurprising that graduates often expect to be handed a standard job of starting salary plus benefits.  The average starting college job these days is a continuation of shunning responsibility.  It's lackluster. Students have spent four or more years being given a fake world of idle and idyll bliss.  It's usually not the real world.\n\nI know I'm drawing huge stereotypes of the average college student here.  I don't want my reference to partying or drinking to be taken out of context; I know not all college students drink their life away.  The more pressing issue is the malaise and lack of initiative that stems from the assumption that college is a requirement for any job and, because of that, that it doesn't much matter what you do aside from graduate.\n\n### Majors\n\nOne of the biggest detractors from the past substance of a college education is the majors themselves.  A major should be a specific field of more intense study, but the push towards a ubiquitous college education has diluted the pool of available majors.  The most popular majors today seem to be English, Communications, Marketing, Business, Management, Accounting, Education, Exercise Science, and Psychology (These taken from college websites, most prominently BYU).   The long tail of majors has changed too, to include things like Recreation and Leisure Services Management, Bowling Services Management, and Ornamental Horticulture.  Now here's the thing, I'm all for specialization - continuing an advanced civilization requires it.  But the problem is that specialization doesn't mean anything, again because of the whole college-education-is-ubiquitous thing.\n\nBut back to the most common majors, things like Marketing, Business and Communications.  What do these mean and what do folks with these majors do after college?  We have a very interesting environment now where a lot of marketing and business majors dream of being managers and come out as executive assistants.  Meanwhile, folks with psychology, education, and child development masters degrees plan on leading schools and end up with jobs at daycares and after-school programs.  So these placements are thought of as entry-level positions, a way to \"get your foot in the door\".  \n\nSo here's a hard but honest question.  Think about some of the more rigorous disciplines: physics, math, any engineering.. when was the last time you heard about someone coming out of school with a degree in one of these subjects not being able to land a job?  Never, right?  Why the difference?\n\nOne possible explanation is market saturation.  There is a huge need for engineers of any discipline.  The same is true for nursing; they are always in demand everywhere.  But the need for marketing folks, or specialists in early childhood development may be smaller, or at least the market may already be covered.\n\nI think this only fulfills a partial explanation.  We hear on the news all the time that the growing need for teachers is an important problem in our society.  And the advertising business is absolutely enormous, supporting huge companies like Google, not to mention the entire TV market.\n\nSo the needs are there.  Why would a marketing major or a child development masters candidate have such problems?\n\nThe underlying problem here is the underlying difference between how these fields are taught.  Alas, I fear I will offend people by saying this even though it seems obvious: *not all degrees are created equal*.  A physics degree is much more rigorous than a marketing degree.  It means more.\n\nHere's what I mean: let's say I'm looking to hire for a position in a field completely unrelated to both physics and marketing.  I have two candidates, both with good qualifications that have moved between fields.  One has a degree in marketing and the other has a degree in physics.  All other things being equal, I would favor the candidate with the physics degree.  Why?  Because they made it through physics, which means they have a certain amount of logical and intellectual rigor, and they know how to think critically.  It doesn't mean the candidate with the marketing degree cannot think critically, it means I have more certainty that the physics candidate can.\n\nAnd that is the core problem: the issue that higher education is designed to tackle has been lost.  It's not the fault of the marketing major.  They've progressed forward into what they expected to be a promising career field based on the input of the colleges they apply to, the high schools they attend, big businesses, and their parents.  And it's not only the wrong answer, it's the wrong question.\n\nA week ago the New York Times ran an editorial called \"College The Easy Way\".  An excerpt:\n\n> Intellectual effort and academic rigor, in the minds of many of the nation’s college students, is\n> becoming increasingly less important. According to the authors, Professors Richard Arum of New York\n> University and Josipa Roksa of the University of Virginia: “Many students come to college not only poorly\n> prepared by prior schooling for highly demanding academic tasks that ideally lie in front of them, but —\n> more troubling still — they enter college with attitudes, norms, values, and behaviors that are often at\n> odds with academic commitment.”\n>\n> Students are hitting the books less and partying more. Easier courses and easier majors have become more\n> and more popular. Perhaps more now than ever, the point of the college experience is to have a good time\n> and walk away with a valuable credential after putting in the least effort possible.\n\nTrue and we all know it.  This is exactly why so many people move on to complete master's degrees.  The bachelor's degree has less meaning.  So to get a leg up on competition people drive towards additional degrees.  In many less rigorous fields, it takes a master's for what a decade ago a bachelors would have accomplished.\n\n### Rigor\n\nThat word seems to keep coming up.  Part of the problem is that, in modern terms, it has a very specific meaning.  In the preface to \"An Intelligent Person's Guide to Philosophy\", Roger Scruton describes the problem:\n\n> Philosophy is not the only subject that has been 'scientized' by the modern university: literature has\n> been shrunk to 'literary theory', music has been colonized by set theory, Schenkerian analysis, and\n> generative linguistics, and architecture has been all but abolished by engineering.  Pretended science\n> has driven honest speculation from the intellectual economy, just as bad money drives out good.  This\n> Gresham's law of the intellect operates wherever university teachers in the humanities exchange knowledge\n> and imagination for the chimera of scientific 'research'.  A philosopher should certainly make room for\n> scholarship: but scholarship has no 'results', no explanatory 'theories', no methods of experimentation. \n> It is, at best, a spiritual discipline, and what will emerge from scholarship depends intimately on the\n> soul of the person who engages in it.  \n\nBelieving what Scruton says, I feel somewhat sheepish using a physics major to compare in my example above.  One thing science does well is provide a reasonable system of rigor based, at its core, on reason and maths.  What it does poorly, especially when taught, is break the connection between scholarship, intuition, and the given field of study.  The modern science student less frequently engages their soul in their study.  They never, as [Whitman would suggest](http://www.bartleby.com/142/180.html), \"[look up] in perfect silence at the stars.\"  \n\nThis separation is sad enough in fields like physics, where intuition and philosophic fields like epistemology have played such a major role in the last two centuries.  How much more sad is it when subjects are 'scientized' out of place?  If the english major, for instance, is reduced to literary theory and analysis, who is going to teach the next generation of poets to write evocatively and stir our souls?  It won't be our universities.\n\n### Work\n\nBut perhaps it never was in the first place.  Perhaps the frequency with which true art, science, and scholarship have been associated with higher education is statistically uncorrelated.  Historically, only a minority of the population was ever capable of such feats because only a minority received an education.  But as the fundamentals of language and accessibility to resources (i.e. the Internet) increases for all of humanity, this lack of correlation will become more noticeable.  It certainly diminishes the idea that research is one of the principal reasons for education.  Which means the only real reason for higher education, as it stands today, is training and specialization for a continually more advanced commercial and industrial civilization.\n\nThis newly trained workforce expects to get jobs out in the world.  They write cover-letters and resumes.  They interview and maybe get placed in a 9-5 job with a cube and a lunch break.  And they expect to do that for forty years or so before having enough money to retire and do nothing.  (It's sad that most people think of retirement as a time when they don't have to work.)  If they don't get a job, they keep working at it by writing more cover-letters and applying to more jobs in the hopes of getting their foot in the door so that they can \"do something.\"   Compare this with writer Elizabeth Gilbert who, in her TED talk at the age of 40, estimated she had \"about four decades left of real, solid work left in me.\"\nCompare this with [Scott's dire situation, struggling to get on the bottom rung of the jobs ladder](http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2010/08/this_is_why_the_american_dream.html).\n\nThe biggest disservice to humanity from higher education is the intense focus on this process.  It points everyone towards the idea of a \"job\".  Almost nobody I know focuses on or considers \"work\" anymore.  The two words have become completely interchangeable.  \n\nIt cannot be understated how profound this equivalence is.  Work - in proper context to humanity - ought to be a joyous and fulfilling activity in a way that a job rarely is.  Work also ought to have no set equality to the gain of money that a job usually does; even more unfortunate today where a job is usually a direct trade of time for money.\n\nThe really odd thing about those stuck in the cover-letter/resume/interview thing is that there is no better time to do or learn to do work.  Being unemployed provides an abundance of time to write, to learn a trade, to learn to draw, to learn to think more, to do any of a huge number of activities that enrich individuals and have the potential to enrich humanity.  But those stuck in the get-a-job cycle don't think they can do any of those things without a job.  And nearly everyone, including the latent deep-thinkers of this generation, are subsumed into this cycle because that's where universities direct them.  When you step outside the process, it sounds like the weirdest thing for higher education to do.  \n\n### Fixing the System\n\nSo what do we do?  It's entirely possible that the job mentality of the last hundred years or so is a historical artifact - a transition phase as we understand more about getting things done in the post-industrial information age.  If that's true, it will sort itself out over a couple of generations.  We've seen glimmers of this in the last ten years with the new trends in online learning.  \n\nThere's two major issues that will perpetuate the current college system.  The first will sort itself out as part of the market.  The other, I'm not really sure.\n\nThe first problem is the general mentality that everyone needs a college degree.  A college degree is seen as an important credential to get a job.  In the edge case, where everyone has one, the credential doesn't actually mean anything anymore.  Young people will need a new discriminator to separate themselves (Master's Degrees anyone?)\n\nIt's kind of a dumb credential, for a bunch of the reasons above, but that's how it's perceived.  Happily, market saturation - the total number of people with this credential - and the cost of getting it - tuitions have been skyrocketing if you haven't noticed - will sort this out.  It's a market problem, and the market will properly price the credential.  Right now it's in a bubble, and bubbles reset and adjust as needed.\n\nWhen that happens, I'm hoping other credentials will become more meaningful to take up some of the slack.  Community colleges, trade schools, and online learning all should have a more prominent place in our view of credentialing people for jobs.\n\n\nThe other problem is bigger.  I actually remember exactly when I recognized this problem.  I was visiting family in Ithaca, and we went to the gym at Ithaca College for a workout.  I was walking to the weight room on the 2nd floor, looking over a balcony at a kid shooting hoops by himself in an empty basketball court.  For some reason, my mind transplanted the view into an episode of MTV Cribs, and saw this kid shooting hoops by himself, on his own basketball court in his house.  So what's the problem?\n\nI hypothesize that most people are more wealthy and more free while they live at college than any other time in their life.\n\nI'm not sure yet how valid this is, but there's some sense to it.  In college, you have more free time than at practically any other time in your life.  Sometimes you should go to class, but you don't have to (and many don't).  You have more easy access to more of your peers than at any other time.  You have more resources and infrastructure - more food, more buildings, more bandwidth.  You have free swimming pools, weight rooms, basketball courts, astroturf fields, walking paths, climbing walls, and whatever else colleges provide.  In fact, most colleges are in an arms race to keep providing more and more to students.  They're building huge sports complexes and beautifiul dorms.  The rising costs of colleges come from all of this stuff, not because classes suddenly cost so much more.\n\nWhen you're in college, you have it all.  Most people subconsciously perceive this life as the ideal life waiting for them when they finally succeed.  When they \"make it\" out in the world, they'll have the basketball court next to the garage with their 8 cars.  They'll laugh while sipping drinks with all their friends in the middle of the day.  It's good to have\n\n\nCommunity college, skilled labor, thinking and Veritas \n\nAn employee needs to be able to write well. Speak well think well. So a vocational school would teach that in the ideal. So there shouldn't be a real difference between that and college. Note that medieval history doesn't help this especially the shopping mall curricula we have now.\n\nFixing the condition of an enjoyable and work-filled life for the majority, and enabling them to think beyond the conditions education sets them now.  But also allowing an environment where those that both can and want to  to think.\n\n\"Perhaps you, Dear Reader—like me—are surprised to learn that a hotbed of scholarly inquiry like UNLV actually has a philosophy department in the first place. But, putting aside any special needs UNLV might have concerning the ontology or metaphysics of college basketball, or the ethical justification for bribery of student athletes, I suppose it makes sense, if only for the sake of curricular completeness.\"\nFrom http://epicureandealmaker.blogspot.com/2011/04/first-lets-shoot-all-philosophers.html\n.\n.\n.\n\nWealth and colleges.. the lone basketball player on his own court at Ithaca.  Seeing people meet each other in the gym there.  One of the most striking purposes of college is to clump people together.  In the best cases, smart people with similar interests clump together, but even generally people clump.\n\n*Universities are what towns ought to be!*\n\nCraftsmanship!!!  We, engineers, scientists are by and large craftsmen on a different part of the spectrum from woodworkers or architects.\n\n### Conclusion?\n\n\nSomewhere along the way, college stopped being about learning how to think for the betterment of ourselves, our work and our leisure, and started being a prerequisite for a job.  It became a value proposition, where a certain amount of predestined background training was proffered as a dowry for a certain level of salary and benefits.  This value proposition is the root cause of the losing battle to debt that college students face now.  As colleges have tried to engineer the level of the proposition, the payout in salary has not kept up.  Once we revert back to the original purpose of college, craftsmanship and knowledge, the abilities of our thinkers won't suffer from myopia due to such a shallow payoff.\n\nThe joy of human existence, in all its fragility, deserves better than a Sisyphean pursuit of jobs.  The transformation of higher education to attain this goal alone sets us all back.  The student becomes an employee.  The professor becomes a teacher of the incoming semi-trained industrial workforce.  [Our thinkers](http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/s/schopenhauer/arthur/lit/chapter5.html) become absent.  And all of humanity will miss them for their poetics, their dialectics, their art, and their science.\n\n\n\n##### A personal footnote\n\nFor a long time I had a lot of trouble with where I went to college.  I went to the University of Maryland - a fine school - and the root cause of my frustration was that I thought in retrospect that maybe I should have gone to UVA or MIT or someplace more.. *prestigious*.  But in writing this I've started to realize that when I look back on my experience at Maryland, the thing I rea`lly struggle with is rigor.  I expect that somewhere else would have been more rigorous.  \n\nI've since blown a big wide hole in my own thought process on college.  Half or more of the reason I'm frustrated with my time spent there is frustration at myself.  *I* should have been more rigorous.  *I* should have paid more attention.  *I* should have been more ambitious.  I would have liked the opportunity to have professors that led me in the right direction, but placing that onus squarely on a teacher's shoulders is avoiding the problem.  Learning, not teaching.  The idea of guidance is correct here, wherein an inquisitive student can be guided to learn more.  But the main focus is learning.  I place too much blame on my college experience on where I went and not enough on the process and on myself.\n\n\n\n===\nWhat would happen if you separated the education from the credential?  In terms of necessary and sufficient, is the credential even necessary anymore, nevermind sufficient?\n\nOnline learning, and where the value of college is going if everyone has it.\n","html":"<h3 id=\"worth\">Worth</h3>\n\n<p>College, as it stands in the modern age, seems to have two real purposes.  The first is to (eventually) produce more PhD's to feed back into the system, usually driven to continue to do research in their field.  But research is a relatively loose term at colleges today.  Often it means that the professor is working on some theory with direct application to a field.  Many professors are starting companies to continue their labors, especially on the STEM side.  The association with economic or industry applications is direct even at the post-doc level.</p>\n\n<p>The places where pure, unapplied research occurs are perhaps less common now than they used to be, at least as compared to the whole of research, and more constrained.  Mathematics is one example.  Specialized mathematics can be hard to place in application for decades or even centuries.</p>\n\n<p>So we can ask: what is research and who does it?  What is the responsibility of a professor - teacher, researcher, or both?  How does the title of \"professor\" differ from \"academician\"?  Is rate of output the primary measure that leads to tenure?  Why?  Where do the truly revolutionary ideas come from in the modern era?  Are they supposed to come from professors or research?  Does it even make sense to ask where these ideas come from?</p>\n\n<p>At first, the struggle between teaching, research and publication struck me as a negative trend, and I felt somewhat uncomfortable about today's crop of professors.  But I've changed tack.  The \"Equal-Odds\" rule suggests that people in a given field have equal odds to produce the Next Big Thing as they do to produce a ton of cruft.  In other words, you have to be prolific and willing to produce a lot of crap to also produce something amazing.  In addition, focusing on hard research problems is <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/hs.html\">sailing upwind</a> - to use Paul Graham's nomenclature - to the problem of tenure.  Tenure is a <a href=\"http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2007/07/17/understanding_engineers_feasibility/\">trivial problem</a>, insofar as there is a well-formed (though difficult) solution to achieving it.  Solving or producing work on hard (non-trivial) problems is more difficult than receiving tenure.  </p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, some of the most amazing human thought in recent decades - regardless of direct application - has come from pure research.  I'm thinking especially of Princeton's IAS and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)#Legacy\">Xerox's PARC</a>, but there are many others as well.  In the case of IAS, many fields have been furthered in a phenomenal way with minimal attachment to funding, political stance, or today's issues.  In the case of PARC, a lot of IT and CS innovation was developed in one complex in the 60s and 70s.  Other examples exist too.  The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser#History\">laser</a> was first described as a solution without a problem.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from the PhD and research recycling process, the second far more common purpose for college is to produce reasonably skilled workers for the commercial-industrial-political complex.  Widespread secondary education only started with the industrial revolution, and the continued forward economic progress of the world has only increased the desired skill level for the average worker.</p>\n\n<p>Research is definitely correlated to the power and purpose of higher education.  Understanding the desire to produce relatively skilled workers feels like a key to the connection.  Perhaps the industrial and technological advances of the last couple hundred years have closed the gap between what used to be the abstract fields of academics and the more everyday applications of real life?  Perhaps the graduating senior is only so different from the new PhD as a matter of degree?</p>\n\n<p>{something here}</p>\n\n<p>But what does that mean for how we think of colleges?  Has our cultural template for college kept up with the changes?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"prestige\">Prestige</h3>\n\n<p>Now I feel a bit weird talking about college prestige.  Two people in my life are closely tied to recruiting and marketing for two different colleges.  So with that in mind, I want to be specific.  Choosing a college, if you go to college, is very important.  It will effect your outlook on the world in a profound way and it can be some of the best years of your life.  Choosing wisely to make the most of your life is important, but the definition of \"choosing wisely\" probably has a different set of criteria than most people think.</p>\n\n<p>One of those wrong criteria is often prestige.  Don't be fooled by prestige.  The question of prestige is a much different one than which college will provide you the best (learning) experience.  Prestige is a combination of branding, honor, history, and, only minimally, rigor.  Once you're out of college, where you went to college is virtually meaningless in most cases.  There isn't a long gradient of prestige, with lots of colleges and universities spread all over the gradient.  I think this is what most colleges try to make you think.  </p>\n\n<p>As far as prestige, there are in fact four types.  Here they are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Harvard.  Look, if you get into Harvard, you ought to go.  The complete short list is Harvard, Yale, Princeton.  MIT and Caltech are the tech equivalent.  Oxford and Cambridge on the other side of the pond.</p>\n\n<p>Why is this true?  When Harvard existed in the 18th century, who went there?  General education in the same form as today didn't exist then for a very good reason: most people didn't <em>need</em> it.  It wasn't something they would use to make money and to support themselves.  Jobs didn't ask for their major.  Then the industrial revolution hit, and suddenly everything changed.  But the original purpose of the Harvard's, the Yale's, the Cologne's.. they were for the most creative and brilliant (and rich) people to pursue the most creative arts in the world and for the most scientifically proficient to pursue the most scientific.  It wasn't education the same way that college is now.  And it still isn't in some sense.  Additionally, the mean caliber of people that attend is incredibly high.  Going to school at Harvard means you're constantly attending class with future CEOs, heads of state, billionaires and politicians.  You'll never be in a better place to build a network of friends and influence.</p></li>\n<li><p>Exceptional colleges.  This is the rest of the Ivy League schools, Stanford, Washington University in St. Louis, University of Virginia, University of Chicago, Duke, maybe a handful of others.</p></li>\n<li><p>Specific prestige for specific departments: Wharton School of Business, very high ranking tech departments.  </p></li>\n<li><p>Everything else.  Sorry, that's just the way it is.  There's no difference between Western State University and Typical College.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is not a justification for going to any of these schools.  An experience at Typical College may in fact be far better than lots of other schools.  You might meet your spouse there.  And there's nothing here about educational standards or finances.  In fact there's nothing here about anything except prestige.   Prestige is one of the prime marketing tools for colleges.  But the hype about prestige is largely irrelevant, especially when it comes to getting a job after college.  In the rare cases it is relevant, you already know the college name (Harvard) and they don't need to market much.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of colleges might disagree with this.  <em>You</em> might disagree with it, and that's a testament to how well colleges market prestige, because what I'm actually advocating is that it doesn't matter at all.  They'll tell you that it matters where you go, that their English department is better than other schools of a similar size or price.  Their swimming pools are bigger, the dorms are better, the computer labs are more complete.</p>\n\n<p>No.  For the core competency of any college - that is to say <em>learning</em> - none of that matters at all.  I heard the provost of some university or other on NPR awhile ago say (paraphrasing) \"but we're an academic institution.  Teaching is what we do.\"  That's a big difference from a statement like \"Learning is what we do\".  You can teach to a completely passive audience. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"idleandidyll\">Idle and Idyll</h3>\n\n<p>Which is why none of these things really matter.  A good professor can enhance and encourage the learning of their interested students, but not their disinterested students.  On the other hand, a student can still learn in spite of a bad professor.  Even when there are good professors, interested in teaching, how often are the grades and classes based off the grad student TAs instead?</p>\n\n<p>A good student can learn anywhere.

A continued 4 years of teaching - or perhaps training - is required after high school before entering nearly any field.  </p>\n\n<p>I should specify that adults think this is true.  College students think something else.  They see college as a time of learning, which is a far better perspective than the adults have.

A major should be a specific field of more intense study, but the push towards a ubiquitous college education has diluted the pool of available majors.  The most popular majors today seem to be English, Communications, Marketing, Business, Management, Accounting, Education, Exercise Science, and Psychology (These taken from college websites, most prominently BYU).

So these placements are thought of as entry-level positions, a way to \"get your foot in the door\".  </p>\n\n<p>So here's a hard but honest question.  Think about some of the more rigorous disciplines: physics, math, any engineering.. when was the last time you heard about someone coming out of school with a degree in one of these subjects not being able to land a job?

Why would a marketing major or a child development masters candidate have such problems?</p>\n\n<p>The underlying problem here is the underlying difference between how these fields are taught.  Alas, I fear I will offend people by saying this even though it seems obvious: <em>not all degrees are created equal</em>.  A physics degree is much more rigorous than a marketing degree.  It means more.</p>\n\n<p>Here's what I mean: let's say I'm looking to hire for a position in a field completely unrelated to both physics and marketing.  I have two candidates, both with good qualifications that have moved between fields.  One has a degree in marketing and the other has a degree in physics.  All other things being equal, I would favor the candidate with the physics degree.  Why?  Because they made it through physics, which means they have a certain amount of logical and intellectual rigor, and they know how to think critically.  It doesn't mean the candidate with the marketing degree cannot think critically, it means I have more certainty that the physics candidate can.</p>\n\n<p>And that is the core problem: the issue that higher education is designed to tackle has been lost.  It's not the fault of the marketing major.  They've progressed forward into what they expected to be a promising career field based on the input of the colleges they apply to, the high schools they attend, big businesses, and their parents.  And it's not only the wrong answer, it's the wrong question.</p>\n\n<p>A week ago the New York Times ran an editorial called \"College The Easy Way\".  An excerpt:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Intellectual effort and academic rigor, in the minds of many of the nation’s college students, is\n  becoming increasingly less important. According to the authors, Professors Richard Arum of New York\n  University and Josipa Roksa of the University of Virginia: “Many students come to college not only poorly\n  prepared by prior schooling for highly demanding academic tasks that ideally lie in front of them, but —\n  more troubling still — they enter college with attitudes, norms, values, and behaviors that are often at\n  odds with academic commitment.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Students are hitting the books less and partying more. Easier courses and easier majors have become more\n  and more popular. Perhaps more now than ever, the point of the college experience is to have a good time\n  and walk away with a valuable credential after putting in the least effort possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>True and we all know it.  This is exactly why so many people move on to complete master's degrees.  The bachelor's degree has less meaning.  So to get a leg up on competition people drive towards additional degrees.  In many less rigorous fields, it takes a master's for what a decade ago a bachelors would have accomplished.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rigor\">Rigor</h3>\n\n<p>That word seems to keep coming up.  Part of the problem is that, in modern terms, it has a very specific meaning.  In the preface to \"An Intelligent Person's Guide to Philosophy\", Roger Scruton describes the problem:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Philosophy is not the only subject that has been 'scientized' by the modern university: literature has\n  been shrunk to 'literary theory', music has been colonized by set theory, Schenkerian analysis, and\n  generative linguistics, and architecture has been all but abolished by engineering.  Pretended science\n  has driven honest speculation from the intellectual economy, just as bad money drives out good.  This\n  Gresham's law of the intellect operates wherever university teachers in the humanities exchange knowledge\n  and imagination for the chimera of scientific 'research'.  A philosopher should certainly make room for\n  scholarship: but scholarship has no 'results', no explanatory 'theories', no methods of experimentation. \n  It is, at best, a spiritual discipline, and what will emerge from scholarship depends intimately on the\n  soul of the person who engages in it.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Believing what Scruton says, I feel somewhat sheepish using a physics major to compare in my example above.  One thing science does well is provide a reasonable system of rigor based, at its core, on reason and maths.  What it does poorly, especially when taught, is break the connection between scholarship, intuition, and the given field of study.  The modern science student less frequently engages their soul in their study.  They never, as <a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/142/180.html\">Whitman would suggest</a>, \"[look up] in perfect silence at the stars.\"  </p>\n\n<p>This separation is sad enough in fields like physics, where intuition and philosophic fields like epistemology have played such a major role in the last two centuries.  How much more sad is it when subjects are 'scientized' out of place?  If the english major, for instance, is reduced to literary theory and analysis, who is going to teach the next generation of poets to write evocatively and stir our souls?  It won't be our universities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"work\">Work</h3>\n\n<p>But perhaps it never was in the first place.  Perhaps the frequency with which true art, science, and scholarship have been associated with higher education is statistically uncorrelated.  Historically, only a minority of the population was ever capable of such feats because only a minority received an education.  But as the fundamentals of language and accessibility to resources (i.e. the Internet) increases for all of humanity, this lack of correlation will become more noticeable.  It certainly diminishes the idea that research is one of the principal reasons for education.  Which means the only real reason for higher education, as it stands today, is training and specialization for a continually more advanced commercial and industrial civilization.</p>\n\n<p>This newly trained workforce expects to get jobs out in the world.  They write cover-letters and resumes.  They interview and maybe get placed in a 9-5 job with a cube and a lunch break.  And they expect to do that for forty years or so before having enough money to retire and do nothing.  (It's sad that most people think of retirement as a time when they don't have to work.)  If they don't get a job, they keep working at it by writing more cover-letters and applying to more jobs in the hopes of getting their foot in the door so that they can \"do something.\"   Compare this with writer Elizabeth Gilbert who, in her TED talk at the age of 40, estimated she had \"about four decades left of real, solid work left in me.\" <br />\nCompare this with <a href=\"http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2010/08/this_is_why_the_american_dream.html\">Scott's dire situation, struggling to get on the bottom rung of the jobs ladder</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest disservice to humanity from higher education is the intense focus on this process.  It points everyone towards the idea of a \"job\".  Almost nobody I know focuses on or considers \"work\" anymore.  The two words have become completely interchangeable.  </p>\n\n<p>It cannot be understated how profound this equivalence is.  Work - in proper context to humanity - ought to be a joyous and fulfilling activity in a way that a job rarely is.  Work also ought to have no set equality to the gain of money that a job usually does; even more unfortunate today where a job is usually a direct trade of time for money.</p>\n\n<p>The really odd thing about those stuck in the cover-letter/resume/interview thing is that there is no better time to do or learn to do work.  Being unemployed provides an abundance of time to write, to learn a trade, to learn to draw, to learn to think more, to do any of a huge number of activities that enrich individuals and have the potential to enrich humanity.  But those stuck in the get-a-job cycle don't think they can do any of those things without a job.  And nearly everyone, including the latent deep-thinkers of this generation, are subsumed into this cycle because that's where universities direct them.  When you step outside the process, it sounds like the weirdest thing for higher education to do.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"fixingthesystem\">Fixing the System</h3>\n\n<p>So what do we do?  It's entirely possible that the job mentality of the last hundred years or so is a historical artifact - a transition phase as we understand more about getting things done in the post-industrial information age.  If that's true, it will sort itself out over a couple of generations.  We've seen glimmers of this in the last ten years with the new trends in online learning.  </p>\n\n<p>There's two major issues that will perpetuate the current college system.  The first will sort itself out as part of the market.  The other, I'm not really sure.</p>\n\n<p>The first problem is the general mentality that everyone needs a college degree.  A college degree is seen as an important credential to get a job.  In the edge case, where everyone has one, the credential doesn't actually mean anything anymore.  Young people will need a new discriminator to separate themselves (Master's Degrees anyone?)</p>\n\n<p>It's kind of a dumb credential, for a bunch of the reasons above, but that's how it's perceived.  Happily, market saturation - the total number of people with this credential - and the cost of getting it - tuitions have been skyrocketing if you haven't noticed - will sort this out.  It's a market problem, and the market will properly price the credential.  Right now it's in a bubble, and bubbles reset and adjust as needed.</p>\n\n<p>When that happens, I'm hoping other credentials will become more meaningful to take up some of the slack.  Community colleges, trade schools, and online learning all should have a more prominent place in our view of credentialing people for jobs.</p>\n\n<p>The other problem is bigger.  I actually remember exactly when I recognized this problem.  I was visiting family in Ithaca, and we went to the gym at Ithaca College for a workout.  I was walking to the weight room on the 2nd floor, looking over a balcony at a kid shooting hoops by himself in an empty basketball court.  For some reason, my mind transplanted the view into an episode of MTV Cribs, and saw this kid shooting hoops by himself, on his own basketball court in his house.  So what's the problem?</p>\n\n<p>I hypothesize that most people are more wealthy and more free while they live at college than any other time in their life.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure yet how valid this is, but there's some sense to it.  In college, you have more free time than at practically any other time in your life.  Sometimes you should go to class, but you don't have to (and many don't).  You have more easy access to more of your peers than at any other time.  You have more resources and infrastructure - more food, more buildings, more bandwidth.  You have free swimming pools, weight rooms, basketball courts, astroturf fields, walking paths, climbing walls, and whatever else colleges provide.  In fact, most colleges are in an arms race to keep providing more and more to students.  They're building huge sports complexes and beautifiul dorms.  The rising costs of colleges come from all of this stuff, not because classes suddenly cost so much more.</p>\n\n<p>When you're in college, you have it all.  Most people subconsciously perceive this life as the ideal life waiting for them when they finally succeed.  When they \"make it\" out in the world, they'll have the basketball court next to the garage with their 8 cars.  They'll laugh while sipping drinks with all their friends in the middle of the day.  It's good to have</p>\n\n<p>Community college, skilled labor, thinking and Veritas </p>\n\n<p>An employee needs to be able to write well. Speak well think well. So a vocational school would teach that in the ideal. So there shouldn't be a real difference between that and college. Note that medieval history doesn't help this especially the shopping mall curricula we have now.</p>\n\n<p>Fixing the condition of an enjoyable and work-filled life for the majority, and enabling them to think beyond the conditions education sets them now.  But also allowing an environment where those that both can and want to  to think.</p>\n\n<p>\"Perhaps you, Dear Reader—like me—are surprised to learn that a hotbed of scholarly inquiry like UNLV actually has a philosophy department in the first place. But, putting aside any special needs UNLV might have concerning the ontology or metaphysics of college basketball, or the ethical justification for bribery of student athletes, I suppose it makes sense, if only for the sake of curricular completeness.\"\nFrom <a href=\"http://epicureandealmaker.blogspot.com/2011/04/first-lets-shoot-all-philosophers.html\">http://epicureandealmaker.blogspot.com/2011/04/first-lets-shoot-all-philosophers.html</a> <br />\n.\n.\n.</p>\n\n<p>Wealth and colleges.. the lone basketball player on his own court at Ithaca.  Seeing people meet each other in the gym there.  One of the most striking purposes of college is to clump people together.  In the best cases, smart people with similar interests clump together, but even generally people clump.</p>\n\n<p><em>Universities are what towns ought to be!</em></p>\n\n<p>Craftsmanship!!!  We, engineers, scientists are by and large craftsmen on a different part of the spectrum from woodworkers or architects.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion?</h3>\n\n<p>Somewhere along the way, college stopped being about learning how to think for the betterment of ourselves, our work and our leisure, and started being a prerequisite for a job.  It became a value proposition, where a certain amount of predestined background training was proffered as a dowry for a certain level of salary and benefits.  This value proposition is the root cause of the losing battle to debt that college students face now.  As colleges have tried to engineer the level of the proposition, the payout in salary has not kept up.  Once we revert back to the original purpose of college, craftsmanship and knowledge, the abilities of our thinkers won't suffer from myopia due to such a shallow payoff.</p>\n\n<p>The joy of human existence, in all its fragility, deserves better than a Sisyphean pursuit of jobs.  The transformation of higher education to attain this goal alone sets us all back.  The student becomes an employee.  The professor becomes a teacher of the incoming semi-trained industrial workforce.  <a href=\"http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/s/schopenhauer/arthur/lit/chapter5.html\">Our thinkers</a> become absent.  And all of humanity will miss them for their poetics, their dialectics, their art, and their science.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"apersonalfootnote\">A personal footnote</h5>\n\n<p>For a long time I had a lot of trouble with where I went to college.  I went to the University of Maryland - a fine school - and the root cause of my frustration was that I thought in retrospect that maybe I should have gone to UVA or MIT or someplace more.. <em>prestigious</em>.  But in writing this I've started to realize that when I look back on my experience at Maryland, the thing I rea`lly struggle with is rigor.  I expect that somewhere else would have been more rigorous.  </p>\n\n<p>I've since blown a big wide hole in my own thought process on college.  Half or more of the reason I'm frustrated with my time spent there is frustration at myself.  <em>I</em> should have been more rigorous.  <em>I</em> should have paid more attention.  <em>I</em> should have been more ambitious.  I would have liked the opportunity to have professors that led me in the right direction, but placing that onus squarely on a teacher's shoulders is avoiding the problem.  Learning, not teaching.  The idea of guidance is correct here, wherein an inquisitive student can be guided to learn more.  But the main focus is learning.  I place too much blame on my college experience on where I went and not enough on the process and on myself.</p>\n\n<p>===\nWhat would happen if you separated the education from the credential?

We have progressed in terms of noise.  \n\tIn terms of information.  But Game changing?  [...]  Progress implies that man is striving \n\ttoward something.  What has the technological boom progressed?  I'm honestly curious.  \n\tI don't understand.\n\nI don't understand either.  I don't really think anyone does yet.  But it seems reasonable to say that we are in a fascinating age of wonder and discovery, of speed and communication, of information and technology.\n\nThe human notion of progress presents a perception of constant forward motion even though it rarely is.  There are always side steps or backward steps before we eventually figure anything out.  We humans have no real foresight.  We're never sure of what the big leaps will be until we've found them, and they always seem obvious to us (and awesome) in hindsight.\n\nUnquestionably, the last two hundred years have been an amazing leap forward for our world.  The Industrial Revolution sparked a huge amount of human productivity and invention.  There have been difficulties - we've spoiled ourselves, our fellow humans, and the environment (sometimes drastically) - but the world has become generally better in that time.  Cities are cleaner, life expectancies and infant mortalities are lower, and education and quality of life are higher.\n\nIn the last century, the improvements in technology have only quickened.  The computer especially has completely overhauled almost every field of study it has touched and has changed our ways of life permanently.  We've come to think of information, spatial distance between people, and communication completely differently than we did even ten or twenty years ago.\n\nSo where are all these changes leading?  What are we striving towards, as my friend so genuinely asked?  I hope to address this question and suggest a few parts of our lives that will continue to change, and hopefully for the better.\n\n### The Age of the Internet\n\nI remember many, including me, being surprised when Time magazine and others picked Johannes Gutenberg and his printing press to be the No. 1 most important person or invention of the 2nd millennium.  Lots of other inventions seem like they could eclipse the lowly printing press: Edison's light bulb, Newton's Principia, Tesla and AC power.  But before the printing press, every piece of information had to be meticulously transcribed by hand, something both time consuming and severely limited by human capital.  In producing the first way to easily produce and transmit information for a wide audience completely justifies Gutenberg's No. 1 placement.  \n\nThe only invention I would put in front of it is the Internet.\n\nThe Internet only just made it into the 2nd millennium, and when those lists were drawn up in '97, it was still very hard to see all of the potential.  Plus, the Internet and it's progress is a huge combination of human effort.  Even the largest contributors - the Tim Berners-Lee's and the Google's - only make up small fractions of the invention.\n\nThe Internet deserves to be Number One for the same reason that Gutenberg did: there is no better way to record information.  We are only in the opening volleys of the Internet Age, and we are only seeing the initial forms this information will take.  And yet the reach of this thing, already measured in billions of people, eclipses every medium that came before it.  Except books of course.\n\nIn order to propagate, every little idea, piece of information, or human thought needs a container for storage and transportation.  This container, we'll call it a bucket, must be stable to allow an audience of multiple people to \"read\" the same thing.  For ages the primary bucket has been the written word, usually a book.  Even if it was passed on verbally from person to person, or in a lecture, once it could be written down it lived much longer.  Where once the book was the only real option, the internet has drastically expanded the types of buckets available.  Storage and stable transport of information has never been easier.\n\nConsider blogging as a small example.  People used to write in a journal with an audience of 1, give or take a few.  Later, they might send an email occasionally to a few people.  With a blog, what they have to say can be distributed to whomever can find it, a potential audience of everyone on the internet, and all of them will read the same thing.  It's no surprise then that there are more ideas-- or at least more words from more people fighting for the same attention.\n\nJust like books, information and attention are the primary forces of computers.  The ability to perform computation has become incidental.  For the first sixty years or so, the primary measures of a computer were processors and memory.  In the last decade, those measures have changed to information and attention.  Except for perhaps a writer, a computer detached from the internet is almost completely worthless today.  \n\nTo borrow a word from religion, there is a soteriology of technology here.  'Computers' were originally human calculators; masses of people, usually women, who carried out numeric portions of larger problems.  We passed that off to huge machines that could do some of the same things.  As these machines got smaller and faster they were able to provide solutions for more problems, and they invented new problems to solve.  \n\nOnce they were connected together, they could disperse and touch nearly every problem humans have.  Computers deal with heart problems, medical imaging, space science, travel bookings and money transfers.  They manage stock markets and search for patterns in science and commerce.  They handle massive amounts of manufacturing and track agricultural efficiency.  Name a branch of modern humanity, and it's likely we would be far less sophisticated without computers.\n\nThis is literally the only human invention in the history of our civilization that can make such a claim.  The book is the only other thing that even comes close.  And this new technology is well less than a century old!  We are in the earliest infancy of an age of revolution. \n\n### A definition\n\nOk, you might say, this new technology we call computers has touched many parts of our lives.  It has led to unprecedented efficiency and information exchange.  What exactly is so revolutionary about that?  It's a change perhaps, an improvement hopefully, but a revolution?\n\nI recently listened to an interview with ____ on econtalk.org.  He was talking about the idea of the singularity.  If you've heard of the notion, I'll say I don't really agree with most versions of the idea.  But his history is great.  \n\nHe outlined three major and dramatic changes in the history of our species.  The first was the start of our very existence anywhere from 100,000-300,000 years ago.  Our nomadic and comparatively squalid existence could be considered rough now, but our toolmaking and culture were a dramatic shift in the history of the Earth.\n\nThe next great shift was roughly 10,000 years ago when some of our nomadic ancestors stopped in place.  They decided to settle for awhile and took up farming.  Before this, humans generally subsisted on what they could catch at any particular time.  One person could only accommodate the food needs of several others at best.  But with farming, they could grow and produce much more than before.  Specialization of skills, cities, and most of culture were byproducts of this shift.\n\nMost of our modern human history continued this way.  ____ mentioned that a farmer in Roman times would not be very out of place farming in 1600.  There were may have been a few improvements, but not much had changed.  Then the Industrial Revolution hit, and things changed dramatically again.  Our production abilities increased to never before seen numbers.  A single farmer could provide enough cotton for clothes or grain for food to satiate hundreds.  Others produced machines to process these goods, or to specialize in other never-before-used products.  The night was lit more than ever before, first by tons of whale oil lamps which replaced candles, then later by electric light bulbs.  Efficiency continued to multiply on itself, and population right along with it.  Humans increased in population from well under a billion in 1800 to over 3 billion in 1950 and 6 billion now.  In the 1960s, some thought our agricultural efficiency gains were over and untold millions would face starvation.  But then Borlaug proved them wrong with genetically modified wheat and continued the multiplying trend.\n\nA farmer from the time of the American Revolution would have no idea how to survive in our world a mere 230 years later.  The changes are completely staggering.  \n\nAnd we haven't even considered computers yet.  When we reply snarkily to our parents or grandparents about some computer problem, we're reminded of just how quickly things have changed.  Arthur C. Clarke famously defined technology as \"anything invented after you were born.\"  These days, that's a lot.  And it's hard to keep up.\n\nStill, the computer is an invention within the lifetime of many.  The actual machine has progressed far from some of the original ideas of people like Georg Boole and Ada Lovelace.  A few have even made modern versions of __  thinking Machine.  And it worked.\n\nBut the first real computers were in the 30s and 40s.  They had massive memory drums and enormous room-sized \"CPU\"s.  The history of these machines mirrors our own in improvement, but in microcosm.  The complete story has filled books, so I won't dwell here.  The transistor created dramatic improvements in speed, and Moore's Law has steadily held for over sixty years.\n\nA lesser followed parallel track follows the application of these machines.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBucket theory, books and computers and the internet: the bucket of all smaller buckets..\n\nSoteriology of computer languages.. you couldn't really use java to do what C did.. you can't really use X to do what Y did..  not that you couldn't in the Turing meaning, but that you couldn't in the humans-couldn't-grok-it way.  So are we evolving towards smaller DSL style languages for particular applications?  Variations on a theme?\n\nProgramming languages alone are a microcosm of this soteriology.  The original machine languages of the 40s and 50s were operationally sparse.  They were theoretically Turing-complete, but they could never do what later languages could do.  They had to be built on a big stack.  You had to have assembly to get C.  You needed C to get Java.  You needed well-defined machines and virtual machines to get higher-level languages.  Lisp stands out in this stack, because it's ancient but so detached from the machine itself.  Abelson said famously that \"programs should be written for a human to understand, and only incidentally for a machine to compute\" (get ) \n\n\nDefinition of a computer: a novel container for information.  It's gone far past its original meaning of a complex calulator.  \n\nNormalization as the most important thing we do.  It is our advantage over other animals.  It's what lets us build abstractions that don't leak too much and that we can build other abstractions on.  Again, not on the theorem-proving level, but on the humans-couldn't-grok-it level.  Example:  Truck heights and interpass heights.  If this wasn't normalized, all of commerce would essentially break down.\n\nThe internet will never go away... it will only absorb other types of info or networks..  \n\nAccess to it will become ubiquitous.  \n\nThe need for talking will decrease as ubiquity increases.. since the internet includes ways to communicate that are often far more efficient and impersonal (and thus \"easier\")\n\nThe perceived need for school will diminsh since so much knowledge can be found by search.\n\nHumanity will increasingly cluster into cities or urban life but this will be based on information access rather than the older support structures.  \n\nThe power of a computer (aside from scientific computing) is also no defined by it' access to information.  A computer not on the Internet is now almost worthless..\n\nA wealth of information creates a poverty of attention -- ?\n\nloopt and eyes\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/pattie_maes_demos_the_sixth_sense.html - the internet and ubiquity.. it's connected to you not devices.\n\nThe future of telepathy - how different is the way we text now from telepathy?  Only two improvements need to be made to reach what someone could legitimately call telepathy: we need a way to accept/read signals directly and we need a way to send signals directly, without the need to type or talk or whatever.  The second fo these is probably quite a bit harder, but neither should seem that far out at this point.  We're within a generation or two of achieving something like that.\n\nHuman communication - when people talk they talk over each other constantly, they don't listen, they don't  say what they mean and the other person doesn't get what they say.  College students embrace this in IM.  High school students embrace this in text.  I can, with written communication, embrace what I want to say as closely as possible with no such distraction as facing another human being directly.  I can accommodate my thought completely and then hopefully pass it on for appropriate response.\n\nDoes this sound stoic?  I hope not, it's a riot.  The written word, not speech, is the most fundamental communicative medium of civilization.  And it's the one that will last in the 21st century and beyond.  Not voice, not video.  Text.  There's a reason books have survived this long.\n\n\nKolmolgorov Complexity and compressibility.\n\nWhat's the difference between communication and information?  Some people prefer texting to phones and typing to talking.  Is less communication generated this way, or less information?  Certainly two friends sitting with each other by a fire can have a more complete and engaging human experience than if they type over a keyboard from hundreds of miles away.  Perhaps the most intriguing point of inquiry is the carnal communication of sex.  Can this communication be defined as simply some set of information exchanged between people?  Or is there something incompressible about the experience that can't be reduced or defined?\n\nThe internet of things and how it will relate to the current internet.  How things will change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganization:\n\nA brief history\n\nExtrapolate out from here\n\nConclusions on what this means in terms of communication vs. information, etc.\n\nSome of the dangers\n","html":"<p>Recently, a good friend and I had an interesting back and forth over email.

When we reply snarkily to our parents or grandparents about some computer problem, we're reminded of just how quickly things have changed.  Arthur C. Clarke famously defined technology as \"anything invented after you were born.\"  These days, that's a lot.  And it's hard to keep up.</p>\n\n<p>Still, the computer is an invention within the lifetime of many.  The actual machine has progressed far from some of the original ideas of people like Georg Boole and Ada Lovelace.  A few have even made modern versions of __  thinking Machine.  And it worked.</p>\n\n<p>But the first real computers were in the 30s and 40s.  They had massive memory drums and enormous room-sized \"CPU\"s.  The history of these machines mirrors our own in improvement, but in microcosm.  The complete story has filled books, so I won't dwell here.  The transistor created dramatic improvements in speed, and Moore's Law has steadily held for over sixty years.</p>\n\n<p>A lesser followed parallel track follows the application of these machines.  </p>\n\n<p>Bucket theory, books and computers and the internet: the bucket of all smaller buckets..</p>\n\n<p>Soteriology of computer languages.. you couldn't really use java to do what C did.. you can't really use X to do what Y did..  not that you couldn't in the Turing meaning, but that you couldn't in the humans-couldn't-grok-it way.  So are we evolving towards smaller DSL style languages for particular applications?  Variations on a theme?</p>\n\n<p>Programming languages alone are a microcosm of this soteriology.  The original machine languages of the 40s and 50s were operationally sparse.  They were theoretically Turing-complete, but they could never do what later languages could do.  They had to be built on a big stack.  You had to have assembly to get C.  You needed C to get Java.  You needed well-defined machines and virtual machines to get higher-level languages.  Lisp stands out in this stack, because it's ancient but so detached from the machine itself.  Abelson said famously that \"programs should be written for a human to understand, and only incidentally for a machine to compute\" (get ) </p>\n\n<p>Definition of a computer: a novel container for information.  It's gone far past its original meaning of a complex calulator.  </p>\n\n<p>Normalization as the most important thing we do.  It is our advantage over other animals.  It's what lets us build abstractions that don't leak too much and that we can build other abstractions on.  Again, not on the theorem-proving level, but on the humans-couldn't-grok-it level.  Example:  Truck heights and interpass heights.  If this wasn't normalized, all of commerce would essentially break down.</p>\n\n<p>The internet will never go away... it will only absorb other types of info or networks..  </p>\n\n<p>Access to it will become ubiquitous.  </p>\n\n<p>The need for talking will decrease as ubiquity increases.. since the internet includes ways to communicate that are often far more efficient and impersonal (and thus \"easier\")</p>\n\n<p>The perceived need for school will diminsh since so much knowledge can be found by search.</p>\n\n<p>Humanity will increasingly cluster into cities or urban life but this will be based on information access rather than the older support structures.  </p>\n\n<p>The power of a computer (aside from scientific computing) is also no defined by it' access to information.  A computer not on the Internet is now almost worthless..</p>\n\n<p>A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention -- ?</p>\n\n<p>loopt and eyes <br />\n<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/pattie\">http://www.ted.com/talks/pattie</a><em>maes</em>demos<em>the</em>sixth_sense.html - the internet and ubiquity.. it's connected to you not devices.</p>\n\n<p>The future of telepathy - how different is the way we text now from telepathy?  Only two improvements need to be made to reach what someone could legitimately call telepathy: we need a way to accept/read signals directly and we need a way to send signals directly, without the need to type or talk or whatever.  The second fo these is probably quite a bit harder, but neither should seem that far out at this point.  We're within a generation or two of achieving something like that.</p>\n\n<p>Human communication - when people talk they talk over each other constantly, they don't listen, they don't  say what they mean and the other person doesn't get what they say.  College students embrace this in IM.  High school students embrace this in text.  I can, with written communication, embrace what I want to say as closely as possible with no such distraction as facing another human being directly.  I can accommodate my thought completely and then hopefully pass it on for appropriate response.</p>\n\n<p>Does this sound stoic?  I hope not, it's a riot.  The written word, not speech, is the most fundamental communicative medium of civilization.  And it's the one that will last in the 21st century and beyond.  Not voice, not video.  Text.  There's a reason books have survived this long.</p>\n\n<p>Kolmolgorov Complexity and compressibility.</p>\n\n<p>What's the difference between communication and information?  Some people prefer texting to phones and typing to talking.  Is less communication generated this way, or less information?  Certainly two friends sitting with each other by a fire can have a more complete and engaging human experience than if they type over a keyboard from hundreds of miles away.  Perhaps the most intriguing point of inquiry is the carnal communication of sex.  Can this communication be defined as simply some set of information exchanged between people?  Or is there something incompressible about the experience that can't be reduced or defined?</p>\n\n<p>The internet of things and how it will relate to the current internet.

I think everyone does this at some point - it's a natural and almost expected thing to do.  Everyone uses the same barometers too, and mine was no different.  My first career goal was to make $100,000 a year in salary.\n\nThis sounded very lofty to a new college grad.  It was a lot of money, and I assumed the prestige/fame/expertise/whatever that accompanied it would be concomitant.  I gave myself until 30 to scale this mountain.\n\nI'm past 30 now, and I've seen more than just my own career goals come and go.  It's not the success or failure that matters actually; I succeeded in my own, but in doing so I realized that the scales I and everyone else used were broken.\n\n#### Wrong Metrics\n\nWe gravitate to the most direct and available metrics to measure anything.  For a career, the most direct metrics are: \n\n1. How high have I risen on the corporate ladder?\n2. How much money do I make?\n\nThe problem with (1) is that it's completely relative to either others or time.  You've either outdone your peers or you're old enough to simply be above people younger than you.  Either way, you're comparing yourself to averages, and averages.. aren't very good.\n\nThe problem with (2) is that it's a scalar value that fails to encapsulate an entire career.  There are far too many variables that either go into the salary number or are not reflected in the output.  Is your salary based on some merit you've accomplished or is it based on your boss's expectations?  How many hours-per-week were required to get you there?  Are low hours a sign of efficiency or laziness?  Are high hours a sign of obsession, poor working conditions, or drive?  How much time off did you get?  What other experiences did you have during that time?  What did the money allow you to do?  Did it enhance your life or detract from it?\n\nAs a final judgement of a job, I think that last question is the one that most people miss.  The common metrics for career goals are completely separated from our lives and the qualities that often matter as much - or more! - than our work productivity.\n\nDon't get me wrong, work is an inseparable part of life.  Good work is a necessary condition for a good life.  But the cycle of work in a typical company or a typical 9-to-5 job is usually soul-crushing, dead-end, leads to a spiral of empty consumerism, or some combination thereof.\n\n#### Better Metrics\n\nSo...\n\nNow that I'm a bit further on, I've decided on a new career goal.  And I'm much more satisfied with this one than with my first.  Here it is:\n\n**I want to spend my summers, from June 1 through September 1, at Bethany Beach with my family.**\n\nBefore I list the qualities of this goal that I find satisfying, I should provide some backstory.\n\nI'm married with two kids so far.  My wife's family has been going to Bethany Beach, DE since way before I was born, and my wife grew up spending her summers down there.  Her Mom was a teacher and would take her three kids down to the beach the day after school ended.  Her Dad would come down every Friday night for the weekend.  As a kid growing up, I don't think she could imagine having better summers.\n\nSince my wife and I started dating, I've been spending more and more time at the beach.  I've [fallen in love](http://www.kanonical.io/inspiration/) with it.  The more time I spend there, the happier I am.  More importantly, my family finds peace, unity, and happiness from the time we spend together there.\n\nAt first glance, these ideas don't seem to have much to do with a career, or work at all.  But they do.\n\nFirst, these are the kind of life-enhancing virtues that qualify as valid criterion for studying the quality of a career.  If not for your family and for a satisfying life, why are you working at all?  Because someone told you that you had to?\n\nSecond, there's actually quite a list of things that need to line up to make a summer at the beach happen.  Let's enumerate, shall we?\n\n1. **Flexibility.** Most importantly, this goal is not an excuse to not work.  I want to work.  As I said earlier, good work is vital to a good life.  I'm not a teacher (currently and for the foreseeable future), but I also wouldn't expect to just take a 3 month hiatus.  I plan to work at least 20 hours a week during the summer.  So, I'll need the flexibility to work at the beach, whatever that means.  Obviously, it could mean a lot, but probably some combintion of:\n * My work can be done virtually\n * Whoever I'm working *for* provides a great deal of freedom and responsibility\n * Whoever I'm working *with* has similar principles\n * My workload is variable and can scale up/down as needed.  Maybe some weeks will be 0 and some will be 40.\n * I'm working for myself or with others and can dictate my own schedule and workload\n2. **Financial Success.** Living at the beach for 3 months requires a significant financial commitment.  We either need to own our own house there (vastly preferable) or be able to rent and pay for the whole summer.  Either way, in the more traditional characteristics of a career goal this is a high bar, and will require a large degree of financial success.\n3. **Personal Discipline.** Even though work is important, it's not often at the very top of our list of things-we'd-like-to-do-right-now.  Even less so at the beach when the rest of the family is relaxing on the sand.  Doing this successfully will require a good amount of personal discipline.\n4. **Family Discipline.** My family will need some discipline too.  They'll need to know that 8-11a is Dad's work time and be willing to leave me be for awhile each day.\n\nWhen I first thought of this career goal, it was like a gear in my mind clicked into place.  It makes so much sense for my family and I.  I think it makes a ton of sense for most families honestly, but our current world isn't well-suited for this type of model.  Signs are starting to point in the right direction.  Workplaces are changing and jobs are virtualizing more.  [Smart](http://alexmaccaw.com/) and [motivated](http://paulstamatiou.com/about/) millenials are leading the charge, eschewing typical jobs and traveling the world while writing books, web apps, travel guides, or selling products.  Thank God for them, because the [typical view of the 20-something millenial](http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2010/08/this_is_why_the_american_dream.html) living at home with their parents in a risk-free environment is not especially endearing.\n\nI wish I had that view of life when I was in my early 20's.  It's an incredibly wide-open time of your life, when you have an immense amount of promise, no responsibilities and very little risk.  There is no better time to pursue freedoms and passions than your 20's.\n\nI missed that chance and went the more typical route - a job with salary plus benis.  I had \"expensive\" tastes and liked cars too much.  I'm slowly learning my lesson and starting to pursue freedoms and passions over belongings and belonging.  \n\nI gave myself about ten years for my first career goal.  I'm hoping to do the same this time around.  Hopefully by the time I'm in my early 40's, I'll be spending every summer at the beach with my family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","html":"<p>When I got out of college, I set my first career goal.

I went to University of Maryland with Mark [Edelen] and got my degree in Computer Engineering in 2002, so I've been out of school for about 12 years.\n\nInstead of talking about any specific experiences in my engineering life, I wanted to talk instead about some of the things that I've found to be not just important after school, but surprisingly important.  In other words, I want to talk about a few things that Engineering School doesn't always teach you.\n\nFirst things first, I don't want to give the impression that I don't think school is that important.  It's very important, especially in a discipline like engineering.  The four years I spent at Maryland were inundated with new ideas, new math, new methods.  School is just necessarily limited in focus.  School takes a (theoretically) limited amount of time, with a goal to provide students both technical breadth and depth over a range of topics.  And that's a pretty tall order.\n\nSo I have four different subjects for you today that, in my experience, were undervalued in school but very important in the real world.  I borrowed each of these four subjects from one of my personal heroes: [Freeman Dyson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson).\n\nNot too many people have heard of Freeman Dyson, but he's a wonderfully free scientific thinker and he's had quite an interesting life.  Mostly, he's known for coining the idea of a Dyson Sphere (which actually started as a joke but then became somewhat famous on Star Trek).  He also did some amazing physics, working alongside Richard Feynman on quantum mechanics and QED.  He's written a lot about science, religion, biology, human rights and global warming.\n\nSo, here are my four underrated subjects for you.\n\n### Tools\n\nFirst and foremost, you need to know the tools of your trade extremely well.  School usually focuses on theory, and that makes sense because if you understand all the theoretical principles, it provides a foundation for any further work in the field.  In the real world, when you are building things, your tools matter a lot.  \n\nDyson talks about living through four scientific revolutions: nuclear energy, genetics, computers, and space science.  Those four topics cover almost all of the progress of the 20th century.  He points out that, after the initial theory and research that created these new ideas, the rest of the progress made over decades has all been because the tools have gotten better.\n\nComputers and space science illustrate this best.  The fundamental architecture of computer hardware and software *has not changed* since John von Neumann invented his version in the 40s.  The only difference is that the tools we have are better, and so the machines we have are faster and more powerful.\n\nSpace science is pretty similar - we haven't sent people any further than the moon for fifty years, but we've learned a lot about space - we've discovered hundreds of exoplanets, black holes, gamma rays, all sorts of things.  None of this is new theory, we just have better tools so we can see and measure all of this cool stuff.\n\nIn my specific case, I'm a software engineer, so some more concrete examples might help..\n\nIn college I learned a ton about the fundamentals of software engineering like data structures, algorithms, computer architectures and operating systems.  I learned the mathematical concepts around these things and I learned how to program them.\n\nBut I didn't learn how to use a tool called version control at all.  Version control, for those that don't know, is a way to manage all of the changes that occur when you're writing or modifying code.  \n\nWhen you're writing a program by yourself, like you usually do in school, version control is nice to have but not vital.  Anytime you have more than one person in a codebase, it becomes incredibly important to keep track of all the changes being made.\n\nI also didn't learn how to use an operating system well, or how to use a good text editor or IDE.  \n\nWhen I'm writing software, I do use some of the theory I learned in school, maybe a theoretical concept once or twice a month.  I use version control, operating systems and editors every day, all day.\n\nAnd just in case you're interested in software right now, here's some tools you should work to become a master in right now:\n\n* Git for version control\n* Linux as an operating system\n* vim, emacs or sublime text for editors\n* Ruby or Python for languages\n\nFor other engineering disciplines, I'd bet on Matlab as being an exceptional tool for A LOT of things.\n\nFor all of these tools, mastery takes years.  There's an article out there called \"[Learn Emacs in Ten Years](http://edward.oconnor.cx/2009/07/learn-emacs-in-ten-years)\".  I've watched people edit text in ways that aren't even possible in more normal tools so quickly and easily that I decided to switch my toolset on the spot.  When you watch someone really good use these tools, after you pick your chin up off the floor, you realize it's worth the time to learn them.\n\n### English\n\nAs a software engineer, I know 3 or 4 programming languages very well, and I could get by in maybe half a dozen others.  That's true for most software folks.  So my next subject that you don't always learn in school, but especially in engineering school, is English. \n\nBy far, the most important language I know as a software engineer is English.  I think the most important skill of any engineer anywhere is the ability to communicate clearly.  I specify English because it has evolved to become essentially a universal language across cultures.\n\nCommunication should generally be bi-directional, so there are two parts to why this is so important in engineering.  The first is to be able to listen to your customers.  This is a lot harder than it might sound, because your customers will very typically be wrong about what they want.  That's definitely different than school.  I think if you tell you professor that their project definition is wrong.. you won't get very far.\n\nThere's an apocryphal Henry Ford quote about this you might have heard - he supposedly said \"If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.\" \n\nThe start of communicating well is being able to listen, to ask questions, and to extract what you hear so that you can build a useful and objective mental model of the problem.  \n\nThe second part is being able to effectively declare and describe your ideas.  Our job as engineers is to build things.  All of the things we build have to start in our head, and then we translate them to the world, by equations, drawings, code, words, whatever.  \n\nAnd even the largest crystal palaces you build in your head are effectively worthless if you can't share them with those around you.  The best way to share them is by learning to speak and write effectively.  \n\nBy speaking clearly, whether to a room of a thousand people or to your team of two people, you get to share your mental model, to test it against what others think, refine it, and uncover and fix gaps that might exist.\n\nLearning to write is the last and most important piece.  By learning to write well you can, as one of my favorite writers says, \"[not just] communicate ideas, but generate them also\".  This is probably the biggest reason why learning English well is so important.  Language is the medium by which we all express our ideas.  That's incredibly important, so I'll say it again.  **Language is the medium by which we all express our ideas.** If we can't exercise mastery of the medium, we have no hope of fully expressing our ideas, no matter how wonderful they are sitting in our heads.\n\n### How to ask questions\n\nFor my third subject, I'll move back to Freeman Dyson.  For the 2nd topic, I had no real connection for Dyson to \"English\" except that he was born in Britain, and so of course he knows English extremely well.\n\nDyson loudly declares that he's proud to be a \"heretic\".  What he really means by this is that he works hard to think differently.  People can get awfully religious about subjects far beyond religion.  Sometimes this can be called \"Group-think\" too.  \n\nHow Dyson thinks shows in his work.  He worked hard to convince the world of Nuclear Disarmament during the Cold War and he talks openly about science and religion in a way few scientists do.  More recently, he's been called \"the climate skeptic with the highest IQ in the world\".  By the way, he has some very insightful and well-researched things to say about the climate models used today.  He's not the classic idea we have of an ignorant global warming denier, he just asks some interesting questions that others haven't asked.\n\nAsking questions is an incredibly important and hard thing to do.  First, you have to have the courage to stand up to the orthodox perspective, whether that orthodoxy represents your entire field or your 4-person team.  Next, you have to have a sufficiently detailed mental model of the world to pivot around in your mind and pick at.  Where are the problems?  Why doesn't it feel right?  Finally, you have to be able to effectively communicate the inconsistencies in this model that you find.\n\nSchool asks us questions quite a lot, and by coming up with the right answers we're supposed to show what we're learning.  This works quite well to a point, but unfortunately, getting these answers is the easy part.\n\nA good engineer can answer questions.  A great engineer will ask new questions (and then, of course, help find the answers.)  Don't be afraid to challenge the prevailing lines of thought by asking questions.  When you do, you'll frequently stumble on new ways to see the answers.\n\n*Sidebar:* For Dyson, he found that climate models did a great job at performing CFD calculations on the atmosphere and ocean, but did a poor job understanding the role the land plants and soil play in carbon exchange.  This lead him to focus on traditional land management (forests, proper farming, etc.) as a viable solution to climate change.  He also willingly asked the question, \"is a warmer planet necessarily worse in the long term?\"  \n\n### How to be wrong\n\nWhich brings me to my final subject.  I just said that school asks us a lot of questions.  When we answer, they expect us to be correct.  We're *graded* on our \"rightness\" (correctness), and so we have it ingrained in our heads that our level of knowledge is directly correlated to how right we are.\n\nIn the real world, engineers are wrong ALL THE TIME.  \n\nHere's two really good ways to be wrong.\n\n* Leadership:  Project or system leads are wrong all the time.  When engineering projects reach a sufficient level of complexity, it's impossible for anyone to know everything.  A lead engineer usually has to have very broad knowledge to satisfy all their external interfaces (like customers), and so they have to sacrifice deep knowledge.  The corollary is that they'll frequently either be wrong or need to ask questions of someone with deeper knowledge of a specific topic.  Leadership on engineering projects means learning how to do this effectively and modestly.  In other words, it's perfectly acceptable to not have all of the answers.\n* Modeling: On very tightly constrained problems - like an easy math problem - it's easy to focus on getting the right answer.  But when you start asking new questions, you have to be wrong a lot before you start getting better answers.  Iterating on ideas is your way of making better and better models of the problem you're trying to solve.\nThink about the pedals and steering wheel in your car.  We think of them as completely normal now - a big circle to steer, and then either two or three pedals: clutch, brake, gas.  We'd think of anything else now as \"wrong\".  But in the early days of cars, there were all sorts of wild controls.  It took a lot of iteration to get a consistent and general solution.\n\nSo don't be afraid to be wrong.\n\n### Application\n\nThose are my four subjects.  In having to write them down, it's occurred to me that even though these aren't always taught directly in school, there's no reason any of you can't start applying them right now.  So here's a couple of thoughts on how to do that.\n\n#### Using Tools\n\nFirst, **figure out what the right tools are.**  Find the best people in your field and see what they're using.  Google is your friend - heck, Google is a tool in itself.  Once you've found the right tools, start playing.  I think that's important, make sure you're playing.  If it feels like work, you won't get very far.  \n\nThe best tools are often hard to approach at first.  I mentioned Git earlier.  There are plenty of other version control tools - CVS, Subversion, Mercurial, Perforce.  Right now, the whole software world is moving towards Git, and at first it is downright confusing compared to most of the other tools.  Once you get over a couple hurdles, it really starts to shine.\n\nI mentioned Matlab too.  I know I'm biased - I'm a computer guy.  I'd say that an engineer that is proficient at programming has a big advantage over one that doesn't.  I have a friend that's a Supply Chain Manager at Under Armour that's learning Python and getting his Master's in Applied Math right now.  He sees a big opportunity to use the tools of math and programming to advance his career and his company.\n\nMatlab is where I'd start for any other engineering discipline.  Do the fun stuff with it - make pretty pictures.  Do loop-de-loops with some data.  **The fun stuff keeps you excited, and you'll learn more about the tools that way.**\n\nFun little projects are the best way to use new tools.  A couple of years ago, I wanted to learn a couple new technologies, so I picked a project out.  The Virginia earthquake had just happened, and it had taken a little while to find out all the stats about it, so I wrote a little Twitter app that tweeted out big earthquakes and locations.  I called it [OMGEarthquake](https://twitter.com/omgearthquake).  It was super simple, it just pulled all of the USGS earthquake data, formatted it, stored it and posted it to Twitter anytime there was a big one.  A few hours of play, some cool new technologies, and I ended up with 500ish followers on Twitter.  It was pretty fun to see it used, a few earthquakes hit in the Dominican Republic and I could see all the RTs and quotes from new people percolating the message from my little play project.  OMGEarthquake is still there by the way, but USGS changed their data formats, and I haven't had time to redo it, so it doesn't update anymore.\n\n#### English\n\nThe best way to practice communicating is by writing, which you can do right now.  To some extent, it doesn't matter what you write, just that you write, because practice works wonders.  \n\nThe first few times will suck quite honestly, but practice will make you better, and you'll start to feel a rhythm.\n\nYou should pick something fun and interesting to you.  It doesn't matter if it's soccer, guitars or recipes.  You should also let other people read it.  Letting other people read it means that there's some lower boundary for quality you're holding yourself too.\n\nIf this sounds like a blog, that's because it is.  **You should write a blog.**  Writing a blog is the best non-technical thing you can do for your career while in school. \n\n#### Questions and Wrongness\n\nIn order to ask questions and be wrong, you have to be brave.  Practice speaking up.  Sometimes when people talk loudly and quickly, it's because they're hiding their ignorance.  I can't tell you the number of times someone has started with a simple, \"I'm not sure about this part..\"  and it has unravelled an entire solution.\n\nJust as important as bravery is identity.  I said earlier that we have it ingrained that \"our level of knowledge is directly correlated to how right we are.\"  It's worse than that, because how correct we are or how much knowledge we have often gets wrapped up into our own identity.  We identify with a solution or a piece of knowledge so strongly that it becomes a part of who we are.  As you can imagine, it's very hard to walk away \"being wrong\" in a case like that.  I think this is why people so often cling to their opinions or ideas so long even after being disproved.  So work hard at separating yourself from your ideas.  Your idea can still be wrong while you can be on the right track.\n\nI'll leave you with one of my favorite Freeman Dyson quotes, one that I think encapsulates some of the things I've been trying to say.\n\n>You can't possibly get a good technology going without an enormous number of failures. It's a universal rule. If you look at bicycles, there were thousands of weird models built and tried before they found the one that really worked. You could never design a bicycle theoretically. Even now, after we've been building them for 100 years, it's very difficult to understand just why a bicycle works – it's even difficult to formulate it as a mathematical problem. But just by trial and error, we found out how to do it, and the error was essential.\n- Freeman Dyson\n\n\n","html":"<p><em>This is the transcript of a talk I gave at Howard Community College to Intro to Engineering students, September 2014</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Hi everyone.</p>\n\n<p>My name is Greg  and I'm Vice President and Software Engineer at a small company.

That's incredibly important, so I'll say it again.  <strong>Language is the medium by which we all express our ideas.</strong> If we can't exercise mastery of the medium, we have no hope of fully expressing our ideas, no matter how wonderful they are sitting in our heads.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"howtoaskquestions\">How to ask questions</h3>\n\n<p>For my third subject, I'll move back to Freeman Dyson.  For the 2nd topic, I had no real connection for Dyson to \"English\" except that he was born in Britain, and so of course he knows English extremely well.</p>\n\n<p>Dyson loudly declares that he's proud to be a \"heretic\".  What he really means by this is that he works hard to think differently.  People can get awfully religious about subjects far beyond religion.  Sometimes this can be called \"Group-think\" too.  </p>\n\n<p>How Dyson thinks shows in his work.  He worked hard to convince the world of Nuclear Disarmament during the Cold War and he talks openly about science and religion in a way few scientists do.  More recently, he's been called \"the climate skeptic with the highest IQ in the world\".  By the way, he has some very insightful and well-researched things to say about the climate models used today.  He's not the classic idea we have of an ignorant global warming denier, he just asks some interesting questions that others haven't asked.</p>\n\n<p>Asking questions is an incredibly important and hard thing to do.  First, you have to have the courage to stand up to the orthodox perspective, whether that orthodoxy represents your entire field or your 4-person team.  Next, you have to have a sufficiently detailed mental model of the world to pivot around in your mind and pick at.  Where are the problems?  Why doesn't it feel right?  Finally, you have to be able to effectively communicate the inconsistencies in this model that you find.</p>\n\n<p>School asks us questions quite a lot, and by coming up with the right answers we're supposed to show what we're learning.  This works quite well to a point, but unfortunately, getting these answers is the easy part.</p>\n\n<p>A good engineer can answer questions.  A great engineer will ask new questions (and then, of course, help find the answers.)  Don't be afraid to challenge the prevailing lines of thought by asking questions.  When you do, you'll frequently stumble on new ways to see the answers.</p>\n\n<p><em>Sidebar:</em> For Dyson, he found that climate models did a great job at performing CFD calculations on the atmosphere and ocean, but did a poor job understanding the role the land plants and soil play in carbon exchange.  This lead him to focus on traditional land management (forests, proper farming, etc.) as a viable solution to climate change.  He also willingly asked the question, \"is a warmer planet necessarily worse in the long term?\"  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"howtobewrong\">How to be wrong</h3>\n\n<p>Which brings me to my final subject.  I just said that school asks us a lot of questions.  When we answer, they expect us to be correct.  We're <em>graded</em> on our \"rightness\" (correctness), and so we have it ingrained in our heads that our level of knowledge is directly correlated to how right we are.</p>\n\n<p>In the real world, engineers are wrong ALL THE TIME.  </p>\n\n<p>Here's two really good ways to be wrong.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Leadership:  Project or system leads are wrong all the time.  When engineering projects reach a sufficient level of complexity, it's impossible for anyone to know everything.  A lead engineer usually has to have very broad knowledge to satisfy all their external interfaces (like customers), and so they have to sacrifice deep knowledge.  The corollary is that they'll frequently either be wrong or need to ask questions of someone with deeper knowledge of a specific topic.  Leadership on engineering projects means learning how to do this effectively and modestly.  In other words, it's perfectly acceptable to not have all of the answers.</li>\n<li>Modeling: On very tightly constrained problems - like an easy math problem - it's easy to focus on getting the right answer.  But when you start asking new questions, you have to be wrong a lot before you start getting better answers.  Iterating on ideas is your way of making better and better models of the problem you're trying to solve.\nThink about the pedals and steering wheel in your car.  We think of them as completely normal now - a big circle to steer, and then either two or three pedals: clutch, brake, gas.  We'd think of anything else now as \"wrong\".  But in the early days of cars, there were all sorts of wild controls.  It took a lot of iteration to get a consistent and general solution.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So don't be afraid to be wrong.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"application\">Application</h3>\n\n<p>Those are my four subjects.  In having to write them down, it's occurred to me that even though these aren't always taught directly in school, there's no reason any of you can't start applying them right now.  So here's a couple of thoughts on how to do that.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"usingtools\">Using Tools</h4>\n\n<p>First, <strong>figure out what the right tools are.</strong>  Find the best people in your field and see what they're using.  Google is your friend - heck, Google is a tool in itself.  Once you've found the right tools, start playing.  I think that's important, make sure you're playing.  If it feels like work, you won't get very far.  </p>\n\n<p>The best tools are often hard to approach at first.  I mentioned Git earlier.  There are plenty of other version control tools - CVS, Subversion, Mercurial, Perforce.  Right now, the whole software world is moving towards Git, and at first it is downright confusing compared to most of the other tools.  Once you get over a couple hurdles, it really starts to shine.</p>\n\n<p>I mentioned Matlab too.  I know I'm biased - I'm a computer guy.  I'd say that an engineer that is proficient at programming has a big advantage over one that doesn't.  I have a friend that's a Supply Chain Manager at Under Armour that's learning Python and getting his Master's in Applied Math right now.  He sees a big opportunity to use the tools of math and programming to advance his career and his company.</p>\n\n<p>Matlab is where I'd start for any other engineering discipline.  Do the fun stuff with it - make pretty pictures.  Do loop-de-loops with some data.  <strong>The fun stuff keeps you excited, and you'll learn more about the tools that way.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Fun little projects are the best way to use new tools.  A couple of years ago, I wanted to learn a couple new technologies, so I picked a project out.  The Virginia earthquake had just happened, and it had taken a little while to find out all the stats about it, so I wrote a little Twitter app that tweeted out big earthquakes and locations.  I called it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/omgearthquake\">OMGEarthquake</a>.  It was super simple, it just pulled all of the USGS earthquake data, formatted it, stored it and posted it to Twitter anytime there was a big one.  A few hours of play, some cool new technologies, and I ended up with 500ish followers on Twitter.  It was pretty fun to see it used, a few earthquakes hit in the Dominican Republic and I could see all the RTs and quotes from new people percolating the message from my little play project.  OMGEarthquake is still there by the way, but USGS changed their data formats, and I haven't had time to redo it, so it doesn't update anymore.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"english\">English</h4>\n\n<p>The best way to practice communicating is by writing, which you can do right now.  To some extent, it doesn't matter what you write, just that you write, because practice works wonders.  </p>\n\n<p>The first few times will suck quite honestly, but practice will make you better, and you'll start to feel a rhythm.</p>\n\n<p>You should pick something fun and interesting to you.  It doesn't matter if it's soccer, guitars or recipes.  You should also let other people read it.  Letting other people read it means that there's some lower boundary for quality you're holding yourself too.</p>\n\n<p>If this sounds like a blog, that's because it is.  <strong>You should write a blog.</strong>  Writing a blog is the best non-technical thing you can do for your career while in school. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"questionsandwrongness\">Questions and Wrongness</h4>\n\n<p>In order to ask questions and be wrong, you have to be brave.  Practice speaking up.  Sometimes when people talk loudly and quickly, it's because they're hiding their ignorance.  I can't tell you the number of times someone has started with a simple, \"I'm not sure about this part..\"  and it has unravelled an entire solution.</p>\n\n<p>Just as important as bravery is identity.  I said earlier that we have it ingrained that \"our level of knowledge is directly correlated to how right we are.\"  It's worse than that, because how correct we are or how much knowledge we have often gets wrapped up into our own identity.  We identify with a solution or a piece of knowledge so strongly that it becomes a part of who we are.  As you can imagine, it's very hard to walk away \"being wrong\" in a case like that.  I think this is why people so often cling to their opinions or ideas so long even after being disproved.  So work hard at separating yourself from your ideas.  Your idea can still be wrong while you can be on the right track.</p>\n\n<p>I'll leave you with one of my favorite Freeman Dyson quotes, one that I think encapsulates some of the things I've been trying to say.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You can't possibly get a good technology going without an enormous number of failures. It's a universal rule. If you look at bicycles, there were thousands of weird models built and tried before they found the one that really worked. You could never design a bicycle theoretically. Even now, after we've been building them for 100 years, it's very difficult to understand just why a bicycle works – it's even difficult to formulate it as a mathematical problem. But just by trial and error, we found out how to do it, and the error was essential.\n  - Freeman Dyson</p>\n</blockquote>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2014-09-10T01:31:28.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-01-06T03:02:08.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2014-09-27T01:30:42.000Z","published_by":1,"visibility":"public","mobiledoc":null,"amp":null},{"id":102,"uuid":"e46d2e81-5f25-4400-9997-5894b6b7f884","title":"Skeumorphism in Fifty Years","slug":"skeumorphism-in-fifty-years-2","markdown":"\nWill Ive's move away from them be seen as something larger in the future?

I'm hoping this will be a tradition every year, since writing things down makes them more real.  So without further ado..\n\n#### 10K: 55:00\n\nI've never officially done a 10K.  I'm planning on the first one being in late April, and my goal is 55 minutes or under.  I did a few 5Ks this year and got down in the 24:xx minute range, and I think I can get my form back to that point relatively quickly.  Doubling the distance will be a new variable, so double 27:30s seems like a good starting point.  I'd love to do another a bit further on in the year and make that first number a 4, but a sub 50:00 10K seems like a big stretch right now.\n\n#### New Bethany Beach Duathlon Goal\n\nA big 2014 goal was doing the Bethany Beach Duathlon in September.  I had tentatively set a goal of 1:50:00, which seemed hard but possible.  I beat it with a 1:46:51 and it was a blast to both train for and participate, so this year demands a new goal.\n\n**1:40:00 is the new goal**.  This will take pushing.  My bike time last year was pretty great (top 30), but I completely lost it during the run and dropped a lot of time.  To make 1:40, I'll need to have the same or better bike stage and follow it up with 9 minute miles on the run.  I know I can save a minute or two in transition also.\n\nThere's one other great thing about this goal: it's lower than Matt's time from this year (barely).  If Matt does it again, I want to make it a real contest.  Of course, his strength is running and he can improve a lot on the bike.\n\nOne other thing about this year - I want to get as many people as I can to do the race with me.  This includes my wife, father-in-law, other friends, and anyone else interested.\n\n#### Captains of Crush #2\n\nAbout 3 years ago, I got within a hair's width of closing [this gripper](http://www.ironmind-store.com/No2-Captains-of-Crush-Hand-Gripper/productinfo/1252/) (195 lbs of force required).  I'd like to do it for real, and hopefully be well on the way to closing the 2.5 or 3.  I've got grippers on my desk at work and I'm using them 3x per week.\n\n#### Reading: A book a month\n\nThis was my wife's goal last year, and she seemed to be reading constantly.  On top of that, the past year or so is the first time in my living memory where I haven't been constantly reading.  I used to be reading 2-4 books at any given time and go through 2 or so a week.  But life gets busy and that has slowed to a crawl.  It's time to rekindle.  I'll be tracking on [Good Reads](https://www.goodreads.com/mhyrr)\n\n#### Writing: A post a month\n\nI'm woefully behind on my writing habit as well.  At least one post per month, length irrelevant.  This one doesn't count, so 13 for 2015.\n\n#### Coding Project\n\nI haven't done much coding away from my job since [OMG Earthquake](https://twitter.com/omgearthquake).  I enjoy exploring and it's time to get back to learning more actively.\n\n#### The Year of Future Plans\n\nSomehow 2015 also feels like a great moment to pause and reflect on the next stages in life.

They have all of the lat/longs, the towns, the conditions, timing, etc.  The notifications, updates, and visualizations for something like this could be extensive.  But every weather app or page I've ever seen that actually shows NWS advisories just punts and shows this wall of text.  And for good reason, it's awful.\n\n#### Forecasts and Probabilities\n\nThere is some hope for general weather conditions and forecasts.  I spent just enough time on NOAA's [NDFD API docs](http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/) to say \"screw this\", but the [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/api) seems promising.  There's at least a lot of easily reachable data available.  \n\nBut there's still a lot of room for improvement.  The largest issue during the Blizzard of 2015 two weeks ago, was the track adjustment that caused Boston to get clobbered while NYC skirted the edges and came away with not a lot of snow.  It was enough of a \"debacle\" to make the [lead NWS forecast apologize publicly](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2015/01/27/why-the-snow-forecast-for-new-york-city-was-so-bad-and-what-should-be-done/).\n\nAnd yet... only 10 or 20 years ago, I feel like this would have been a major success.  They were able to predict days early that a minor Alberta clipper would regroup off the Mid-Atlantic coast and twirl into an obscenely strong Noreaster.  From what little I know, this was an immensely complicated sitution that both meteoroglogists and models had to handle.  They missed the exact track of the storm by about the length of Long Island.\n\nThe missing ingredient was the range of possibilities for the storm: in model terms, the equivalent \"ensembles\".  Meteorologists work hard to intuit their forecast out of a huge can of model data, including many different runs of the same model with slightly varied input conditions.  This provides a variety of model scenarios.\n\nBut very rarely does this information translate to the general public.  At most, you'll get someone saying \"I think we'll be on the low end of this range.\"  One thing I especially love about [Capital Weather Gang](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/) is how they provide Boom and Bust scenarios along with Confidence ranges in their forecasts.\n\n![Boom/Bust](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/files/2015/01/snow_chances_1-26-v3a.jpg&w=1484)\n\nThis is a great way to take a a good stab at the forecast, while also providing enough detail across a range of scenarios.  And it reminds readers that you are essentially trying to predict the future.\n\nAny forecasting API of the future should take probabilities into account in the data model.  A generalized version of Boom and Bust would work very well.  Translated into a Bell Curve, the Boom and Bust becomes a forecast, say, 2 deviations from the primary estimate, while the Confidence value becomes the standard deviation (controlling the spread).\n\n#### Separating Data\n\nWhat I'd really love to see is a separation of forecast data and forecast presentation.  If it occurred, lots of interesting possibilities open up: you could easily overlay forecasts from different sources, run forecasts against actuals later, or even create a heatmap of which areas some forecasts always nail and where they miss.\n\nI could be wrong here, but it seems as if the public-facing meteorologists of the country would be naturally aligned against this idea.  For the most part, they don't look back at how their forecast missed (at least publicly).  They want to be your go-to source for the weather forecast.  So perhaps this would be an uphill battle.  But one organization could definitely do this: the [NWS](http://www.weather.gov/).  If they got in the business of presenting their data well - models, actuals, forecasts, and probabilities - they could start a swing towards more interesting weather UI presentations, more honest evaluation of forecasting, and a more conscious public knowledgeable about the variation possible in an upcoming storm.  And that's a great thing, not only because the NWS is still known for the horrid text boxes above, but also because the state of the art in weather apps right now seems to be this:\n\n![Effing Weather App](http://effingweatherapp.com/img/slider/slide-1.png)\n\n#### Events\n\nIt may seem like I'm going a bit overboard on this right now because I live near DC and the classic DC snow hole is killing me this winter.  And that's true.  When it's 90 and sunny in July at the beach, I could care less that the standard deviation in high temperature was 2.5 degrees between the various GFS ensembles.\n\nTrue weather disasters is where this will really matter, and snow is the least of those.  I joked about it above, but it really is a bit sad that the tornado warning system of today is still based on sirens and radio stations.  Almost everyone has geo data on their phones, and we've got geo data on every weather event.  If we can receive AMBER alerts on our phones, we ought to be able to receive geographically relevant tornado warnings as well.  The same is true for hurricanes, fires, space weather (X-Class solar flares anyone?), flood watches, severe thunderstorms, and others.  And yet, these sorts of notifications are still tucked away behind a firewall of obfuscation, available only for professional meteorologists, firefighters, police, and related fields.\n\nHere's hoping for a general trend towards a better data model, protocol and API for weather, and the possibility this could make more data available to the general public.  And now I should go update my USGS feed for OMGEarthquake.  I can't wait to do OMGTornado one day.\n\n\n\n\n\n","html":"<p>Weather really needs an API.</p>\n\n<p>I've been thinking about this since I played around with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/omgearthquake\">OMGEarthquake</a> awhile back.  I had originally wanted to make a few additional OMGs for tornadoes, hurricanes, etc.  The problem was data.. I couldn't find any good sources.</p>\n\n<p>To make OMGEarthquake work, I had to hit up USGS for a weirdly-formatted CSV .txt file and parse through it line by line.  Not exactly a modern standard.  They updated it sometime in 2013 and now use an Atom feed format along with a couple of other options.  </p>\n\n<p>But the worst offender by far is NWS.

They have all of the lat/longs, the towns, the conditions, timing, etc.  The notifications, updates, and visualizations for something like this could be extensive.  But every weather app or page I've ever seen that actually shows NWS advisories just punts and shows this wall of text.  And for good reason, it's awful.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"forecastsandprobabilities\">Forecasts and Probabilities</h4>\n\n<p>There is some hope for general weather conditions and forecasts.  I spent just enough time on NOAA's <a href=\"http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/\">NDFD API docs</a> to say \"screw this\", but the <a href=\"http://openweathermap.org/api\">OpenWeatherMap</a> seems promising.  There's at least a lot of easily reachable data available.  </p>\n\n<p>But there's still a lot of room for improvement.  The largest issue during the Blizzard of 2015 two weeks ago, was the track adjustment that caused Boston to get clobbered while NYC skirted the edges and came away with not a lot of snow.  It was enough of a \"debacle\" to make the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2015/01/27/why-the-snow-forecast-for-new-york-city-was-so-bad-and-what-should-be-done/\">lead NWS forecast apologize publicly</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And yet... only 10 or 20 years ago, I feel like this would have been a major success.  They were able to predict days early that a minor Alberta clipper would regroup off the Mid-Atlantic coast and twirl into an obscenely strong Noreaster.  From what little I know, this was an immensely complicated sitution that both meteoroglogists and models had to handle.  They missed the exact track of the storm by about the length of Long Island.</p>\n\n<p>The missing ingredient was the range of possibilities for the storm: in model terms, the equivalent \"ensembles\".  Meteorologists work hard to intuit their forecast out of a huge can of model data, including many different runs of the same model with slightly varied input conditions.  This provides a variety of model scenarios.</p>\n\n<p>But very rarely does this information translate to the general public.

But there are quite a few others to control or sense things like balance and temperature.\n\nThe most interesting to me is [proprioception](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception).  Proprioception is the (usually very subtle) sense of the orientation of your own body in it's environment and the effort and strengths required to accomplish certain movements.  A strong sense of proprioception becomes a great advantage in most sports and, I believe, it's the mostly unknown quality that imparts grace to the motion of dancers, gymnasts and the like.\n\nProprioception has two additional very interesting qualities.  The first is that it can often physically be extended to additional physical objects.  And the second is that it serves as an incredibly useful metaphor for certain key qualities of leadership.\n\n##### Racecars\n\nFor over ten years, I've enjoyed competing in SCCA Solo racing.  It's a relatively simple form of amateur motorsport that focuses on car control above everything else.  \n \nOne of the most fascinating parts of racing cars is that every good driver can relate, predict, and understand the orientation and forces acting on the car as if it's an extension of their own body.  They develop mental models of how the suspension works in a dynamic environment and can apply those models in real-time on their environment - the track.\n\n![Me in the DSP car at 2013 Nats](http://www.gotcone.com/photos/plog-content/images/2013-scca-tirerack-solo-national-championships/dsp/img_4370.jpg)\n\nThis might sound obvious, but I think it's staggeringly important.  Our brains are able to extend, for lack of a better term, our \"field of physical self-awareness\" to an additional object, equating it with our own bodies.  We can translate our tacit understanding of own muscles and movements into an understanding of the shocks, springs, and physical properties of a car.  That's really wild.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the folks that are used to having to orient their bodies, that have a sports background, whether skiing or gymanstics, get in a car and rapidly develop the control skills to be fast.  Their only difficulty is in building the mental model for how a car works versus how their body works.\n\n##### Leadership\n\nEven more interesting than the physical extension of proprioception to another object is the even more subtle extension into an entire group of people.  But this is often what a good leader does.. they \"feel\" the orientation and changing dynamics of their team.  They always seem to know what's going on, who's involved, and what impacts it will have in the future.\n\nBeing able to do this requires an even higher level of mental gymnastics, because there's no physical system to anchor your model.  Instead, the data input to your model has all the mess and caprice of dealing with lots of humans at once.  But if you can do it well, you can guide an organization right through fickle behavior, usually just by providing go/no-go decision points.  \n\nPeople that can do this well often seem staggeringly effective and a little larger than life.  They instill trust in their teams through shear effectiveness; often they almost seem to perform augury.\n\nWhile this is powerful, and, in my opinion, the best kind of leader because of that trust factor, there are a couple of potential downsides.\n\nFirst, the very trust that resonates so strongly to a team can resonate too strongly.  The divination the leader seems to perform can sometimes turn into blind trust by the team and prevent the feedback loop of information that makes the leader so effective.\n\nSecond, it's often far easier for someone in that role to poke 10 or 20 people and get 10 or 20 things done than to do 1 thing deeply and well.  This gives them the self-fulfilling impression that they are hyperefficient and can get loads done, when in fact it's really 10 (or 20 or 100 or 500) people getting things done for them.  It's much easier for the leader to shy away from hunkering down and doing some real work themselves.  \n\nThe best leaders I know, and I know some really incredible ones, have this gift of proprioception.  They always seem to know what's going, they know what's going well and what's going poorly, they know which issues are critical and which can wait, and they know how to motivate and trust their teams to get things done.  They instill trust while making sure the team questions decisions and gives more feedback.  And finally, they're not afraid to get their hands dirty and do some serious work themselves.","html":"<p>Most people think of our interaction with the world through the traditional five senses: vision, hearing, taste, smell, touch.

I started reading my old manuscript from [NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org/) that has sat untouched and dusty for seven or eight years.  It was frightening.\n\nAnd somewhat intoxicating.\n\nYou see, the really scary thing about it was that, amongst the detritus of ideas scattered around, there was some decent writing.  It turns out I was not the terrible dolt that I felt like during that one month of furious typing.  I was still a dolt, just not a terrible one.\n\nThis has lead to some soul searching.

Not sure how that happened, but it's been an eventful and busy year.  We added a porch to our house, I'm much deeper into photography than I expected to be, and, most importantly, we've happily added our third child to our family.  Our house has a constant din of running feet, cries, and laughter.  It's wonderful.\n\nIt also means that life continues to change and my personal goals change with it.  Gone are the hours straight of solitary thinking I used to think were cheap.  Everything at home is now shrink wrapped into neat little packages of 15 minutes or less.  If I'm going to do anything of substance, it's going to be away.\n\nNow I'm not complaining.  I wouldn't change this for the world.  But it does change how I think about my own goals.  It also changes what they are.  I still want to leave a mark, to do something memorable.  But I've also realized that the people I'm fortunate enough to live with and raise are the most indelible ink I can leave on the paper of this world.  I also know that I want to be around as long as possible to see what beautiful scribbles they (and I) end up capturing.\n\nAnd so, here's some goals for the year.  I've got five.\n\n#### Powerlifting\n\nThis year is really about fitness and getting myself nice and healthy.  I find too many opportunities to shovel fast food.  Being 36, I forget I can't eat like I'm 24.  Coupled with kids and a fairly sedentary job that seemingly always takes precedence, I've somehow gained almost 30 lbs over the last couple years.\n\nI've done a killer diet thing before, and I know it can work.  But I've decided to approach this a bit differently and proxy my health goals through athletic goals.  Dieting gets outrageously boring.  Working towards an athletic goal doesn't.\n\nSo here's my first goal: compete in my first powerlifting meet.  What's that you say?  Doesn't seem compatible with a weight goal?  Better go check out [this dude](https://www.instagram.com/larrywheels/) first as an example.  Powerlifters have gotten outrageously in shape (except for maybe the super heavyweights).  It's also a weight classed sport, and the weight class I've chosen to compete in just happens to be my previously sustained natural weight.  If I can get to that weight with some strength, I'll be in really good shape.  It will also mean I'll be eating clean and feel much healthier.\n\nThere's a meet in my area on May 20th, so that's what I'm currently targeting.  That gives me 4+ months to get there.  I've signed up with a powerlifting coach to help with a training and nutrition regimen.  We'll see where this goes.  It will be really fun to focus on lifting heavy things, which will also make the diet easier to stomach (har).\n\nPR Goals?  Well earlier this year I hit the following:\nSquat: 425\nBench: 335\nDeadlift: 455\nTotal: 1215\n\nI don't think my bench form will fly in a competition, so I'm not expecting a huge gain there.  I think there's a good amount of room to grow in the squat and the deadlift.  But, I also need to drop weight at the same time, so I'll be very satisfied with anything over 1200.\n\n\n#### Duathlon\n\nAfter May, I plan to drastically switch gears.  I did the Bethany Beach Duathlon three years ago and felt quite accomplished.  I'd like to do it again.\n\nSo in May I plan to take what I've learned about nutrition and redirect my efforts towards running and biking.  That gives me another 16 weeks to get ready, which should be enough.  That said, this is the one I worry the most about, mostly because I'm nervous about how into powerlifting I will be.  It may be hard to switch gears.  \n\nHopefully doing the duathlon with some other people will help.\n\n#### Work/Life Balance, Family Time, and the Right Opportunities\n\nI've been off for a few weeks now with the holidays and a new baby and it's been wonderful.  It's made me think a lot about life balances and choices.  It has solidified my belief that time is more important than money.  \n\nI've started taking a good amount of time off during the summer, so I can enjoy the beach with my family.  That's made a very positive impact.  I don't know what the right opportunity looks like to make an even bigger change in this direction.\n\nBut I know we need to be ready for it.  So this year's goal is to put our money where our mouth is and save, save, save.  We need to learn how to live on less.  This is intentionally vague, but it means setting a budget significantly lower than our income and sticking with it.\n\n#### Just One Thing\n\nAll three of these require that I learn better how to keep a schedule.  I'm naturally a night owl, which means that I steal time at night even when the kids get up at 6 AM.  I need to learn better to set a schedule and stick to it.  The only reliable time I will get to workout will be early in the morning before work, so that will force the issue.\n\nI also need to learn to compartmentalize.  I tend to get wrapped up in 18 things at once and then multi-task and context-switch the shit out of all of them.  This often leads to less than stellar results.  It's an occupational hazard of having many interests.  So I plan to consciously pick my increments of time and use them to do Just One Thing.  It may be work, writing, photography, family, coding, whatever.  But it will be Just One Thing.\n\n#### Sell Some Prints\n\nDamn, I love taking pictures.  I might like processing them and seeing the finished product even more.  The next step is to try to share some of my work, so I'm hoping to get to a point where I can sell some prints.  Beyond an online shop, I'm not sure where or how just yet.  I've got a lot to learn about quality printmaking and framing.  I also tend to be a fairly rigorous judge of my own work, which should help with quality.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Well, shit.</p>\n\n<p>All of a sudden it's 2017.

Tolkien was a diehard - that alone should tell you something.  He invented something over 20 languages in his lifetime.  I've always been horrible with foreign languages, which is perhaps amusing given that I write code for a living.  Code is something different though, more a grammar and a syntax than actual language.

And even more strangely, people sometimes listen<sup>[1](#friends)</sup>.  So I've decided to consolidate the advice that I've given in one semi-long diatribe about health, food, and our bodies.\n\n##### Titles\n\nI had a lot of titles for this post.  Just to be fun, here's some:\n\n* The Only Two Things That Matter For Losing Weight\n* Lose Weight On One Week of Willpower\n* Lose Weight Eating Foods You Love\n* Eat Less, Move More\n- The Value of Being Sore\n\nAnd a bunch of others.  Most seemed shitty and generic.  In other words, they sounded a lot like the kind of crap the fitness industry puts out on a daily basis.  You know, the multi-billion dollar industry that consistently claims to have the secret 7-minute answer to all of your problems.\n\nMost (but not all) of that industry is mind numbingly awful for humanity.  Most of that industry thinks bacon is quite bad for you, and I didn't want to have even a twinge of association with the health and fitness industry oeuvre.. so bacon won.\n\n##### Morbidity\n\nSometime well after this transformation had begun, I was at my favorite Saturday breakfast spot, ritually eating my eggs and bacon while watching an older guy sit outside ritually eat his Saturday breakfast.  I'd seen him before, but had never really noticed him.  He was probably 60, way overweight, chainsmoking cigarettes with shaky hands and inhaling black coffee and a chocolate donut.  He was feigning interest in the sports section, but he couldn't seem to maintain his concentration in between puffing, slurping and chomping.\n\nA one word description of the scene popped into my head and something clicked: this scene was *morbid*.  That word connotes death, and I felt like I was literally watching someone actively kill themselves.  What clicked in my head was why the medical field had chosen the term \"morbid obesity\".  It literally means you are actively killing yourself through food.  It's not the fault of the donut.  It's the context and responsibility around the donut that can make it either a fun treat or a deadly habit.\n\nSince then, I've paid closer attention to all sorts of people in public and the decisions they make about what they eat and how they move.  It's become very clear to me that the everyday decisions we make all the time, each one, can either bring us a fuller life or take us closer to death.  I'm sure that seems very extreme, but that's why it's so frightening.  It's a very slow, gradual process and so we don't notice it everyday.  But it adds up over time.\n\nWhich is exactly what happened to me.  I've always been fairly athletic.  I grew up very active outside and playing sports.  I entered college at about 200 lbs and exited college around 230 - some muscle and growing, some fat.  I'm now in my mid-30s, and for about ten years after college, I hovered right around 240.  \n\n240 seems like a lot.  I'm a big guy, so it's a pretty good 240.  I've always carried a lot of muscle, and even when not actively lifting weights, I could go in and bench somewhere over 250.  Four years ago, I ran a 24:40 5K at that weight (7:59/min miles), and competed in the Bethany Beach Duathlon.  Had I entered in the Clydesdale division (225+), I would've won (I refused on principle).\n\nNobody would ever claim I was skinny, but I certainly wasn't fat.  I could eat pretty much whatever - and I did - and it wouldn't change that much.  Most people guessed my weight at 200.  And for a long time, I was happy with that.\n\nBut then a few things happened.  My wife and I started having kids - 3 in five years - and the midlife metabolic switch kicked in and I lost my ability to inhale food with no ill effects.  The weight started creeping up in a gradual, barely noticeable way.  Jump forward a couple of years and I was suddenly 275 with a decent sized gut, wondering what happened.\n\n##### The Heart\n\nUnfortunately, that still didn't kick me into gear.  But some heart concerns sure did.\n\nI went to see a chiropractor to see if it would help with some mobility for powerlifting (more on that shortly).  While there, he took my blood pressure and got a reading of 170/115.  That is disastrously high - so high that the chiropractor said to me, \"I'm pretty sure that this is wrong.\"  I still got worried, and followed up.\n\nA trip to a primary care doctor confirmed the readings and followed it up with an abnormal EKG.  At this point, I was freaking out and on my way to a cardiologist.  He turned out to be a fantastic doctor.  After calming me down and assuring me that this was almost definitely just essential hypertension (elevated blood pressure with no additional problems), he gave me some extremely sage advice.  He said, \"Listen.  You're going to live a long life and play with lots of grandchildren.  You're just an adult now and you're not invincible anymore.\"\n\n> He said, \"Listen.  You're going to live a long life and play with lots of grandchildren.  You're just an adult now and you're not invincible anymore.\"\n\nTruth.  Hard truth.  I'm not invincible anymore.\n\nSo I set about adulting.\n\n##### Keto\n\nI had already thought that 275 lb. number was a bit high, so I had already been doing some research into the ketogenic diet.  The diet appealed to me for a bunch of reasons.  It had a great scientific explanation.  It helped regulate your insulin levels (I have a family history of diabetes).  It was not pushed too much in the fitness industry.  It let you eat a lot of delicious food.\n\nAfter seeing a cardiologist, it seemed like an imperative.  With confirmation from the cardiologist that this was a good idea, I set about doing it.\n\nSo I should tell you what *it* is, and what I did.  This is also a good time to remind you that I'm not a doctor and you should definitely listen to one.  This is simply the basics at a high level, so here we go..\n\nGenerally glucose is the easiest form of energy your body has, so it will use it if it can.  Glucose (mostly) comes from carbs.  Carbs make your blood glucose and insulin levels spike and cycle based on when and how you eat.  This in turn also causes your appetite to fluctuate and for you to get hungry.  If you eat extra food, your body stores it as fat.\n\nThe ketogenic diet is a very high fat, moderate protein diet.  You eliminate almost all carbs and all sugar from your diet.  In turn, your glucose intake goes to near zero.  After a small period of time while your body adapts to this new world, your body enters a state of ketosis.  This does a few things:  \n\n- It lowers your blood glucose levels\n- It better regulates your insulin\n- After you adapt, it makes you much less hungry (appetite suppression)\n- It forces your body to look for a different energy source.  And so your body makes [ketones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketone_bodies) from fatty acids.  This is where the term ketosis comes from.\n- It reduces your blood pressure\n- Since you're eating less because you're not hungry, your body starts looking for other ways to produce it's new ketone energy source, and it starts harvesting your fat stores\n\nAnd boom, you start losing weight.  Pretty damn quickly.\n\n##### Good Calories, Bad Calories\n\nAs you start reading and learning more about some of the different diets out there, you'll probably run into a religious debate about calories.  \n\nSome people are completely convinced that the only diet rule that matters is how many calories you eat.  As long as you count calories and sit in a calorie deficit (eat less than you use), you'll lose weight.  Macronutrients, timing, sugar, etc. don't matter at all.  \n\nOthers say that managing hormone cycles and macronutrients is the key to weight loss.  The body is a complex system with lots of different and intricately linked metabolic regulatory paths that need to be controlled somewhat to produce any effect.\n\nThe physicist in me - which usually wins - says that of course it's a straight energy equation and calorie counting is the only thing that matters<sup>[2](#math)</sup>.  The biochemist in me says that of course the body regulates and manages the energy supply it gets and uses it in different ways.  There are studies on both sides, and I really don't want to have to care too much about an incredibly complex biological process like the conversion of sunlight to edible plants/animals to human energy.\n\nThe thing I really like about keto is that it covers all the bases.\n\nSee, a keto diet does an incredible job at regulating your insulin cycle and forcing your body into a state where it's used to dealing with very little sugar.  It responds by producing these ketone things from your fat stores.  So there's quite a lot of [chemical trickery](https://www.ruled.me/ketosis-ketones-and-how-it-works/) going on.\n\nAt the same time, the fact that your insulin cycle is suppressed means that you aren't spiking your insulin, and so you don't feel hungry.  So it's also very easy to eat way less calories than your basal metabolic rate says you need (more on that shortly).\n\n##### Practical Keto\n\nNow that we've got some basics down, let's take a look at a practical way to get this rolling.\n\nFirst, go get a BMR calculator and get a sense of your basal metabolic rate.  This is the number of calories your body will burn if you do nothing all day.  If you stay under your BMR everyday for your calorie count, you'll be set.  And if you add exercise, you'll be killing it.\n\nNext, do some research to find the keto foods that you enjoy.  Restricting yourself in any way is hard, especially if you're not used to it, so don't make it extra hard by eating food you don't like.  There's a big difference between this being simple and being easy.  This is definitely hard, so work to keep it nice and simple.\n\nOnce that's set, just get going. Start. Especially at first, having a schedule of a few simple meals that you enjoy will make it super easy to follow.  For the first week or so, use MyFitnessPal or a similar app to track your calories and the amount of fat you're getting.  It's actually hard to get 70-80% fat!  If you get too much protein, your body will end up [producing glucose from the protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluconeogenesis) and you won't enter the state of ketosis.\n\nHere's what worked for me:\n\n* **Breakfast**\n  * Tea with stevia and heavy cream.  Coffee works too.\n  * 3-4 Eggs, maybe with some shredded cheese or spinach\n  * Sausage or bacon.  Omg bacon is delicious.\n* **Lunches**\n  * Leftover dinner stuff\n  * Salad (spinach, green lettuce or 50/50 mix) with a fatty vinaigrette and cheese\n* **Dinner**\n  * A meat and a veggie.  \n* **Snacks**\n  * String cheese\n  * Cheese and Crackers (without the crackers)\n  * Salted peanuts or cashews\n  * Jerky\n* **Other Rules**\n  * Water, water, water.  Over 2L of water a day.  I get a new bottle of Smart Water every day because they have electrolytes, which you'll need.\n  * I cut out soda completely for the first 8 weeks or so.  I'm only drinking water, carbonated water (Perrier, to replace soda), tea, red wine, whiskey on the weekends.  \n  * Even when you bring soda back, diet soda only.  I don't think diet soda is a problem, but I do think it limits the amount of water you drink.  And, for me, the more water I drink, the easier the weight comes off.\n  * No sugar or artificial sweeteners.  We have Stevia now, which is the only sweetener that actually doesn't produce an insulin response.\n  * Get the 80/20 ground beef.  Not only does it fit the diet better, it also tastes better.\n  * Fatty meats or fish are best.  Sausage, pork, steak, salmon.  If you get chicken, make sure you get enough fat.\n  * Full fat butter, heavy cream, full fat sour cream, full fat cream cheese, etc. \n  * No bread or pasta or starch\n  * Don't eat after about 7p (or within 3 hours of bedtime).\n  * Use an Omega 3 supplement - I use krill oil (no aftertaste)\n  * Get enough salt (again, counterintuitive, but you're drinking so much water that you'll need it)\n* **\"Cheat\" Tips**\n  * I am a pizza fanatic, so this was one of the biggest sacrifices.  Fortunately, [Fathead Pizza](http://www.ditchthecarbs.com/2015/04/23/fat-head-pizza/) is absolutely fantastic.  I had this probably once a week and loved it.\n  * Just make the fathead pizza dough and cut it into square slices for \"crackers\".  Eat with cheese or make a sour cream dip.\n  * [The Great Low Carb Bread Company](http://www.greatlowcarb.com/) makes great cinnamon bagels, hamburger rolls and hotdog rolls.  \n  * Pan fried mozzarella-based gnocchi is delicious.\n  * Basically, find things you enjoy.. and eat them.  Use [good resources](https://www.dietdoctor.com/how-to-lose-weight) \n with [delicious recipes](http://www.ruled.me/guide-keto-diet/#).  That way, you won't feel like you have to cheat.\n\nThe first week was definitely tough.  I still wanted \"normal\" food.  But once I got through the bad part, the difference is pretty remarkable.  I feel better, I'm not hungry hardly at all (even tho I'm under 2000 calories a day), and I don't really miss the food much.  It's very sustainable.  \n\n##### The Exercise Part\n\nSo now we've covered literally 90% of the work.  Seriously, diet is by far the biggest component.  Every single time you see one of those completely shredded and strong girls/guys on Instagram, 90% of the effort was in the kitchen.\n\n> Every single time you see one of those completely shredded and strong girls/guys on Instagram, 90% of the effort was in the kitchen.\n\nBut there's that last 10%, and it's definitely important.  It's a habit that changes the way you think, the way you feel, and the way you look.  Diet makes you look good in your clothes.  Exercise makes you look good naked.\n\n> Diet makes you look good in your clothes.  Exercise makes you look good naked.\n\nWhen most people start trying to get into shape, they start running.  So let's get this out of the way.. you shouldn't run<sup>[3](#hiit)</sup>.\n\nThere's only two kinds of people that should run:\n\n1. Runners.  Some people just love to run.  If you're in the camp where you love it enough to do it many times a week.. then this whole article probably doesn't apply to you.\n2. Very competitive people.  If you're determined to compete and this is an outlet for you, then fine.  But there's plenty of other outlets.\n\nNow, why shouldn't you run?  Lots of reasons - it can be boring, it's hard on your joints.. but the biggest reason is that [you won't get the results you want](http://www.shape.com/weight-loss/tips-plans/5-reasons-running-may-not-help-you-lose-weight).\n\nLet's compare:\n![Yeah, no thanks running](https://impossiblehq.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/MARATHONSPRINT.jpg)\n\nMost people want to look more like a sprinter than a marathon runner.  They want muscle definition, a good butt, and a nice back, not efficient, spindly legs.  A few miles at a nice steady pace just doesn't achieve that look.  To look the way you want, you need to ditch fat and build muscle.  And the way to do both of those things is to lift weights.  Heavy weights.  Lots of heavy weights.\n\n##### Powerlifting\n\nWhich is basically what powerlifting is - lifting heavy weights and focusing on the 3 big movements - the squat, the deadlift, the bench press.  These three exercises are the kings of the gym<sup>[4](#oly)</sup>, the best overall movements you can do to build your body and all of your muscles.  Want the best exercise for abs?  That would be the squat.  Second best?  Deadlift.  Best for legs?  Squat.  Second?  Deadlift.\n\nIt's ridiculous how all-encompassing these movements can be.  They work the biggest muscle groups you have, which means they require a huge amount of energy, thus burning tons of calories.  And because they're all barbell movements and require balance, they also work a lot of secondary and core muscles.\n\nPowerlifting is still a niche enough sport that most mainstream people have a skewed perspective.  Most people probably think of a powerlifter like this:\n\n![Big guy](http://i.imgur.com/Gjfz5jd.jpg)\n\nBut that's pretty far from the truth.  Powerlifting as a sport is weight-classed, and if you're going to be the strongest 148 lb. guy around, there isn't much room on your body for fat.  Only the biggest super heavyweights carry a lot of fat.  For instance, all of these guys are 240-300 lbs and still completely jacked.\n\n![The best around, they don't ab roll](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v9ywhy0x7G4/maxresdefault.jpg)\n\nNeed something more realistic?  How about Jesse Norris, one of the best at 198 lbs.\n\n![Freakin strong](http://www.greatestphysiques.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/8-9.jpg)\n\nAnd girls.. don't worry at all about \"getting jacked\".  You won't be muscle-bound, instead your body will get functionally strong while still looking amazing.\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:62.5% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BVPwu0ZhqTL/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">HAPPY MONDAY PEEPS ☀️🌷 Back at it again with the kitchen mirror selfies 😂😂 but this time super happy because 1.

I&#39;ve been lifting for over a year and I much prefer my physique now even if I am a bit &#39;bulkier&#39; 🤷🏼‍♀️ #lovetolift #cardiovsweights #misconception #girlswholift #burncalories #liftweightstoburnfat #teamacf #transformation #beforeandafter</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by Ashley Crooks || #teamACF (@ashleycrooksfitness) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2017-03-29T20:46:47+00:00\">Mar 29, 2017 at 1:46pm PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script>\n\nSo head to the gym and focus on the big barbell movements.  Especially when you start out and the weights aren't that heavy, you can squat every workout.  Find a good program that focuses on the big barbell movements, and add in some accessories near the end of the workout.  CrossFit is another great place to start<sup>[5](#crossfit)</sup>.  I started out using [Jason Blaha's Ice Cream 5x5 Novice Program](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/jason-blaha-ice-cream-fitness-5x5-novice-workout).  I'm a pretty strong guy and it worked great for months.  When you get started, make sure to learn proper form and then push the weights - in that order!  Learn the [RPE scale](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/rpe-scale-heart-health) and how to use it - your sets should be in the RPE 6-8 scale for the most part.  Plan on spending 3-5 hours a week at the gym; about 60-90 minutes per workout.  Get plenty of rest too.  It should be hard and you should be sore.\n\nBeing sore is undervalued today.  Most people live comfortably and happily without much exertion, ever.  But feeling sore the next day is an incredible reminder that you are alive.  That your body is one hell of a machine, and that it is working for you.  That you are actively not dying today.  You are improving and getting better, that's what being sore should tell you.  It feels *GOOD* and it's incredibly motivating to do it again, better, the next time.\n\n> You are improving and getting better, that's what being sore should tell you.  It feels *GOOD* and it's incredibly motivating to do it again, better, the next time.\n\nAnd speaking of motivation, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5xXsdWRaFw) [should](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s86DJ1pVF0U) [definitely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9ywhy0x7G4) [get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvBgWzzBlR8) [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNOMmmf8eWs).\n\n##### Coaching\n\nMotivation is huge.  This type of transformation, a real transformation, takes consistency and dedication.  You've got to want it - not in the \"It would be really cool to have abs on the beach one day\" kinda way, but in the \"holy shit I love this and can't wait to get to the gym today and do some work!\" kinda way.  You've got to love the process, not the outcome.\n\n> You've got to love the process, not the outcome.\n\nTo push yourself and effect change, you've got to be smart about this too.  And that probably means getting a trainer or a coach.  A good one.\n\nA big chunk of personal trainers out there are junk.  The ones at most commercial gyms are junk.  Their purpose is to teach novices how not to get injured<sup>[6](#hurt)</sup> and to inject motivation into the workout.  But look.. if this is going to work, the motivation has to come from you, not from someone else.  It still probably does take someone else to help diagnose your weaknesses, your problems with form, answer questions, and to come up with programming that will push you without overdoing it.\n\nThe nice thing these days is that the internet enables you to find someone good wherever you are.  I found [my coach](http://www.whitneysp.com/) on Instagram, and [he is awesome](https://www.instagram.com/ct_whitney/).  [He's the kind of coach](http://www.whitneysp.com/testimonials.html) you should get.  I post videos to track progress and I get suggestions, criticism, and kudos.  I ask questions and get answers the same day, all the time.  And he leads by example, and works as hard or harder himself than all of his clients.  \n\nAnd that's your motivation.  Find someone better than you and emulate them.  Stop making excuses - and there can be so many made so easily -\n and just start.  Wherever you are, just start. \n\n##### Start\n\nStarting is simple.  But holy crap is it hard.  That's why we like all of those life-changing yet mendacious fitness headlines.  They feel good.  They feel simple.  They make us feel like less of a failure, even as they set us up to fail again.\n\nAnd there is some truth in all of them, just like there's a hard but honest truth in the phrase \"morbid obesity\".  We all have choices to make about life and death.  And choosing to make our lives better really is simple.  Eat less, move more.  Lift Weights.  Be sore on a regular basis.  Make small good choices.  Be consistent.  Work hard.  But above all, just start.  And keep going.\n\n\n###### Footnotes\n\n*1.* <a name=\"friends\"></a>8 or 9 of my friends have done this same diet over the last few months and all of them have had similar success, losing 20-30 lbs.\n\n*2.* <a name=\"math\"></a>You should totally watch [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIlsN32WaE) which describes the math and chemistry behind weight loss.  I was amazed to find that, when I burn fat, it exits the body as 80% CO<sub>2</sub> I breathe out and 20% H<sub>2</sub>O I pee out.\n\n*3.* <a name=\"hiit\"></a>You can definitely do cardio for weight loss.  You just shouldn't do it in place of lifting weights.  If you're already lifting 3 or more times a week, then adding [HIIT and LISS](http://www.simplyshredded.com/cardio-for-fat-loss-high-intensity-interval-training-cardio-vs-low-intensity-steady-state-cardio.html) into your routine will do amazing things.  HIIT stands for High Intensity Interval Training - 30-60 second sprints with rests in between is one example.  LISS is Low Intensity Steady State cardio - just going for a pleasant morning walk.\n\n*4.* <a name=\"oly\"></a>There's another gym route to take, possibly even better than powerlifting, and that's olympic lifting.  The two main lifts here are the snatch and the clean & jerk.  They require all the same core, leg, and major muscle group strength as powerlifting while adding much more flexibility and balance.  If you're starting from scratch, this may be the best route.\n\n*5.* <a name=\"crossfit\"></a>CrossFit is an awesome way to get started.  Where it fails is by making novices think that a WOD by itself will get them where they want to be.  A lot of people see the CrossFit athletes on TV and think that their 20 minute workout is enough.  It isn't.  You need to spend some more time in the gym to move the needle.\n\n*6.* <a name=\"hurt\"></a>It's pretty important to be able to avoid injury.  As the weights have gotten heavier, I've had to learn how to focus more on mobility and flexibility.  A complete novice probably should have at least some in person training to get the gist of what's going on.  CrossFit gyms can excel here.","html":"<p>So recently.. this happened:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BUMVNBWl0p3/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">Not the usual post (can&#39;t believe I put this on IG), but I&#39;m pretty proud of getting up and doing something.

And even more strangely, people sometimes listen<sup><a href=\"#friends\">1</a></sup>.  So I've decided to consolidate the advice that I've given in one semi-long diatribe about health, food, and our bodies.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"titles\">Titles</h5>\n\n<p>I had a lot of titles for this post.  Just to be fun, here's some:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Only Two Things That Matter For Losing Weight</li>\n<li>Lose Weight On One Week of Willpower</li>\n<li>Lose Weight Eating Foods You Love</li>\n<li>Eat Less, Move More</li>\n<li>The Value of Being Sore</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And a bunch of others.  Most seemed shitty and generic.  In other words, they sounded a lot like the kind of crap the fitness industry puts out on a daily basis.  You know, the multi-billion dollar industry that consistently claims to have the secret 7-minute answer to all of your problems.</p>\n\n<p>Most (but not all) of that industry is mind numbingly awful for humanity.  Most of that industry thinks bacon is quite bad for you, and I didn't want to have even a twinge of association with the health and fitness industry oeuvre.. so bacon won.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"morbidity\">Morbidity</h5>\n\n<p>Sometime well after this transformation had begun, I was at my favorite Saturday breakfast spot, ritually eating my eggs and bacon while watching an older guy sit outside ritually eat his Saturday breakfast.  I'd seen him before, but had never really noticed him.  He was probably 60, way overweight, chainsmoking cigarettes with shaky hands and inhaling black coffee and a chocolate donut.  He was feigning interest in the sports section, but he couldn't seem to maintain his concentration in between puffing, slurping and chomping.</p>\n\n<p>A one word description of the scene popped into my head and something clicked: this scene was <em>morbid</em>.  That word connotes death, and I felt like I was literally watching someone actively kill themselves.  What clicked in my head was why the medical field had chosen the term \"morbid obesity\".  It literally means you are actively killing yourself through food.  It's not the fault of the donut.  It's the context and responsibility around the donut that can make it either a fun treat or a deadly habit.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, I've paid closer attention to all sorts of people in public and the decisions they make about what they eat and how they move.  It's become very clear to me that the everyday decisions we make all the time, each one, can either bring us a fuller life or take us closer to death.  I'm sure that seems very extreme, but that's why it's so frightening.  It's a very slow, gradual process and so we don't notice it everyday.  But it adds up over time.</p>\n\n<p>Which is exactly what happened to me.  I've always been fairly athletic.  I grew up very active outside and playing sports.  I entered college at about 200 lbs and exited college around 230 - some muscle and growing, some fat.  I'm now in my mid-30s, and for about ten years after college, I hovered right around 240.  </p>\n\n<p>240 seems like a lot.  I'm a big guy, so it's a pretty good 240.  I've always carried a lot of muscle, and even when not actively lifting weights, I could go in and bench somewhere over 250.  Four years ago, I ran a 24:40 5K at that weight (7:59/min miles), and competed in the Bethany Beach Duathlon.  Had I entered in the Clydesdale division (225+), I would've won (I refused on principle).</p>\n\n<p>Nobody would ever claim I was skinny, but I certainly wasn't fat.  I could eat pretty much whatever - and I did - and it wouldn't change that much.  Most people guessed my weight at 200.  And for a long time, I was happy with that.</p>\n\n<p>But then a few things happened.  My wife and I started having kids - 3 in five years - and the midlife metabolic switch kicked in and I lost my ability to inhale food with no ill effects.  The weight started creeping up in a gradual, barely noticeable way.  Jump forward a couple of years and I was suddenly 275 with a decent sized gut, wondering what happened.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"theheart\">The Heart</h5>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, that still didn't kick me into gear.  But some heart concerns sure did.</p>\n\n<p>I went to see a chiropractor to see if it would help with some mobility for powerlifting (more on that shortly).  While there, he took my blood pressure and got a reading of 170/115.  That is disastrously high - so high that the chiropractor said to me, \"I'm pretty sure that this is wrong.\"  I still got worried, and followed up.</p>\n\n<p>A trip to a primary care doctor confirmed the readings and followed it up with an abnormal EKG.  At this point, I was freaking out and on my way to a cardiologist.  He turned out to be a fantastic doctor.  After calming me down and assuring me that this was almost definitely just essential hypertension (elevated blood pressure with no additional problems), he gave me some extremely sage advice.  He said, \"Listen.  You're going to live a long life and play with lots of grandchildren.  You're just an adult now and you're not invincible anymore.\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He said, \"Listen.  You're going to live a long life and play with lots of grandchildren.  You're just an adult now and you're not invincible anymore.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Truth.  Hard truth.  I'm not invincible anymore.</p>\n\n<p>So I set about adulting.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"keto\">Keto</h5>\n\n<p>I had already thought that 275 lb. number was a bit high, so I had already been doing some research into the ketogenic diet.  The diet appealed to me for a bunch of reasons.  It had a great scientific explanation.  It helped regulate your insulin levels (I have a family history of diabetes).  It was not pushed too much in the fitness industry.  It let you eat a lot of delicious food.</p>\n\n<p>After seeing a cardiologist, it seemed like an imperative.  With confirmation from the cardiologist that this was a good idea, I set about doing it.</p>\n\n<p>So I should tell you what <em>it</em> is, and what I did.  This is also a good time to remind you that I'm not a doctor and you should definitely listen to one.  This is simply the basics at a high level, so here we go..</p>\n\n<p>Generally glucose is the easiest form of energy your body has, so it will use it if it can.  Glucose (mostly) comes from carbs.  Carbs make your blood glucose and insulin levels spike and cycle based on when and how you eat.  This in turn also causes your appetite to fluctuate and for you to get hungry.  If you eat extra food, your body stores it as fat.</p>\n\n<p>The ketogenic diet is a very high fat, moderate protein diet.  You eliminate almost all carbs and all sugar from your diet.  In turn, your glucose intake goes to near zero.  After a small period of time while your body adapts to this new world, your body enters a state of ketosis.  This does a few things:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It lowers your blood glucose levels</li>\n<li>It better regulates your insulin</li>\n<li>After you adapt, it makes you much less hungry (appetite suppression)</li>\n<li>It forces your body to look for a different energy source.  And so your body makes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketone_bodies\">ketones</a> from fatty acids.  This is where the term ketosis comes from.</li>\n<li>It reduces your blood pressure</li>\n<li>Since you're eating less because you're not hungry, your body starts looking for other ways to produce it's new ketone energy source, and it starts harvesting your fat stores</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And boom, you start losing weight.  Pretty damn quickly.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"goodcaloriesbadcalories\">Good Calories, Bad Calories</h5>\n\n<p>As you start reading and learning more about some of the different diets out there, you'll probably run into a religious debate about calories.  </p>\n\n<p>Some people are completely convinced that the only diet rule that matters is how many calories you eat.  As long as you count calories and sit in a calorie deficit (eat less than you use), you'll lose weight.  Macronutrients, timing, sugar, etc. don't matter at all.  </p>\n\n<p>Others say that managing hormone cycles and macronutrients is the key to weight loss.  The body is a complex system with lots of different and intricately linked metabolic regulatory paths that need to be controlled somewhat to produce any effect.</p>\n\n<p>The physicist in me - which usually wins - says that of course it's a straight energy equation and calorie counting is the only thing that matters<sup><a href=\"#math\">2</a></sup>.  The biochemist in me says that of course the body regulates and manages the energy supply it gets and uses it in different ways.  There are studies on both sides, and I really don't want to have to care too much about an incredibly complex biological process like the conversion of sunlight to edible plants/animals to human energy.</p>\n\n<p>The thing I really like about keto is that it covers all the bases.</p>\n\n<p>See, a keto diet does an incredible job at regulating your insulin cycle and forcing your body into a state where it's used to dealing with very little sugar.  It responds by producing these ketone things from your fat stores.  So there's quite a lot of <a href=\"https://www.ruled.me/ketosis-ketones-and-how-it-works/\">chemical trickery</a> going on.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the fact that your insulin cycle is suppressed means that you aren't spiking your insulin, and so you don't feel hungry.  So it's also very easy to eat way less calories than your basal metabolic rate says you need (more on that shortly).</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"practicalketo\">Practical Keto</h5>\n\n<p>Now that we've got some basics down, let's take a look at a practical way to get this rolling.</p>\n\n<p>First, go get a BMR calculator and get a sense of your basal metabolic rate.  This is the number of calories your body will burn if you do nothing all day.  If you stay under your BMR everyday for your calorie count, you'll be set.  And if you add exercise, you'll be killing it.</p>\n\n<p>Next, do some research to find the keto foods that you enjoy.  Restricting yourself in any way is hard, especially if you're not used to it, so don't make it extra hard by eating food you don't like.  There's a big difference between this being simple and being easy.  This is definitely hard, so work to keep it nice and simple.</p>\n\n<p>Once that's set, just get going. Start. Especially at first, having a schedule of a few simple meals that you enjoy will make it super easy to follow.  For the first week or so, use MyFitnessPal or a similar app to track your calories and the amount of fat you're getting.  It's actually hard to get 70-80% fat!  If you get too much protein, your body will end up <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluconeogenesis\">producing glucose from the protein</a> and you won't enter the state of ketosis.</p>\n\n<p>Here's what worked for me:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Breakfast</strong>\n<ul><li>Tea with stevia and heavy cream.  Coffee works too.</li>\n<li>3-4 Eggs, maybe with some shredded cheese or spinach</li>\n<li>Sausage or bacon.  Omg bacon is delicious.</li></ul></li>\n<li><strong>Lunches</strong>\n<ul><li>Leftover dinner stuff</li>\n<li>Salad (spinach, green lettuce or 50/50 mix) with a fatty vinaigrette and cheese</li></ul></li>\n<li><strong>Dinner</strong>\n<ul><li>A meat and a veggie.  </li></ul></li>\n<li><strong>Snacks</strong>\n<ul><li>String cheese</li>\n<li>Cheese and Crackers (without the crackers)</li>\n<li>Salted peanuts or cashews</li>\n<li>Jerky</li></ul></li>\n<li><strong>Other Rules</strong>\n<ul><li>Water, water, water.  Over 2L of water a day.  I get a new bottle of Smart Water every day because they have electrolytes, which you'll need.</li>\n<li>I cut out soda completely for the first 8 weeks or so.  I'm only drinking water, carbonated water (Perrier, to replace soda), tea, red wine, whiskey on the weekends.  </li>\n<li>Even when you bring soda back, diet soda only.  I don't think diet soda is a problem, but I do think it limits the amount of water you drink.  And, for me, the more water I drink, the easier the weight comes off.</li>\n<li>No sugar or artificial sweeteners.  We have Stevia now, which is the only sweetener that actually doesn't produce an insulin response.</li>\n<li>Get the 80/20 ground beef.  Not only does it fit the diet better, it also tastes better.</li>\n<li>Fatty meats or fish are best.  Sausage, pork, steak, salmon.  If you get chicken, make sure you get enough fat.</li>\n<li>Full fat butter, heavy cream, full fat sour cream, full fat cream cheese, etc. </li>\n<li>No bread or pasta or starch</li>\n<li>Don't eat after about 7p (or within 3 hours of bedtime).</li>\n<li>Use an Omega 3 supplement - I use krill oil (no aftertaste)</li>\n<li>Get enough salt (again, counterintuitive, but you're drinking so much water that you'll need it)</li></ul></li>\n<li><strong>\"Cheat\" Tips</strong>\n<ul><li>I am a pizza fanatic, so this was one of the biggest sacrifices.  Fortunately, <a href=\"http://www.ditchthecarbs.com/2015/04/23/fat-head-pizza/\">Fathead Pizza</a> is absolutely fantastic.  I had this probably once a week and loved it.</li>\n<li>Just make the fathead pizza dough and cut it into square slices for \"crackers\".  Eat with cheese or make a sour cream dip.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.greatlowcarb.com/\">The Great Low Carb Bread Company</a> makes great cinnamon bagels, hamburger rolls and hotdog rolls.  </li>\n<li>Pan fried mozzarella-based gnocchi is delicious.</li>\n<li>Basically, find things you enjoy.. and eat them.  Use <a href=\"https://www.dietdoctor.com/how-to-lose-weight\">good resources</a> \nwith <a href=\"http://www.ruled.me/guide-keto-diet/#\">delicious recipes</a>.  That way, you won't feel like you have to cheat.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The first week was definitely tough.  I still wanted \"normal\" food.  But once I got through the bad part, the difference is pretty remarkable.  I feel better, I'm not hungry hardly at all (even tho I'm under 2000 calories a day), and I don't really miss the food much.  It's very sustainable.  </p>\n\n<h5 id=\"theexercisepart\">The Exercise Part</h5>\n\n<p>So now we've covered literally 90% of the work.  Seriously, diet is by far the biggest component.  Every single time you see one of those completely shredded and strong girls/guys on Instagram, 90% of the effort was in the kitchen.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Every single time you see one of those completely shredded and strong girls/guys on Instagram, 90% of the effort was in the kitchen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But there's that last 10%, and it's definitely important.  It's a habit that changes the way you think, the way you feel, and the way you look.  Diet makes you look good in your clothes.  Exercise makes you look good naked.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Diet makes you look good in your clothes.  Exercise makes you look good naked.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When most people start trying to get into shape, they start running.  So let's get this out of the way.. you shouldn't run<sup><a href=\"#hiit\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>There's only two kinds of people that should run:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Runners.  Some people just love to run.  If you're in the camp where you love it enough to do it many times a week.. then this whole article probably doesn't apply to you.  </li>\n<li>Very competitive people.  If you're determined to compete and this is an outlet for you, then fine.  But there's plenty of other outlets.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now, why shouldn't you run?  Lots of reasons - it can be boring, it's hard on your joints.. but the biggest reason is that <a href=\"http://www.shape.com/weight-loss/tips-plans/5-reasons-running-may-not-help-you-lose-weight\">you won't get the results you want</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Let's compare: <br />\n<img src=\"https://impossiblehq.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/MARATHONSPRINT.jpg\" alt=\"Yeah, no thanks running\" /></p>\n\n<p>Most people want to look more like a sprinter than a marathon runner.  They want muscle definition, a good butt, and a nice back, not efficient, spindly legs.  A few miles at a nice steady pace just doesn't achieve that look.  To look the way you want, you need to ditch fat and build muscle.  And the way to do both of those things is to lift weights.  Heavy weights.  Lots of heavy weights.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"powerlifting\">Powerlifting</h5>\n\n<p>Which is basically what powerlifting is - lifting heavy weights and focusing on the 3 big movements - the squat, the deadlift, the bench press.  These three exercises are the kings of the gym<sup><a href=\"#oly\">4</a></sup>, the best overall movements you can do to build your body and all of your muscles.  Want the best exercise for abs?  That would be the squat.  Second best?  Deadlift.  Best for legs?  Squat.  Second?  Deadlift.</p>\n\n<p>It's ridiculous how all-encompassing these movements can be.  They work the biggest muscle groups you have, which means they require a huge amount of energy, thus burning tons of calories.  And because they're all barbell movements and require balance, they also work a lot of secondary and core muscles.</p>\n\n<p>Powerlifting is still a niche enough sport that most mainstream people have a skewed perspective.  Most people probably think of a powerlifter like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Gjfz5jd.jpg\" alt=\"Big guy\" /></p>\n\n<p>But that's pretty far from the truth.  Powerlifting as a sport is weight-classed, and if you're going to be the strongest 148 lb. guy around, there isn't much room on your body for fat.  Only the biggest super heavyweights carry a lot of fat.  For instance, all of these guys are 240-300 lbs and still completely jacked.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v9ywhy0x7G4/maxresdefault.jpg\" alt=\"The best around, they don't ab roll\" /></p>\n\n<p>Need something more realistic?  How about Jesse Norris, one of the best at 198 lbs.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.greatestphysiques.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/8-9.jpg\" alt=\"Freakin strong\" /></p>\n\n<p>And girls.. don't worry at all about \"getting jacked\".  You won't be muscle-bound, instead your body will get functionally strong while still looking amazing.</p>\n\n<p><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:62.5% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BVPwu0ZhqTL/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">HAPPY MONDAY PEEPS ☀️🌷 Back at it again with the kitchen mirror selfies 😂😂 but this time super happy because 1.

Therefore, the more muscle you build, the more calories your body will naturally burn each day at rest #winning &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; I found the picture on the left from 2 yrs ago straight after I completed the ironman. My training consisted of 2 hrs+ of cardio a day and I hadn&#39;t lifted a weight in my life. I had no definition or muscle tone 😨 nearly 2 yrs on, this is me now (all be it my tan may be a little umpa lumpa-ish) but I&#39;ve got a lot more definition and size 🙌🏼 A lot of my clients say to me &#39;will this make me big and bulky&#39; when I get them to lift any kind of weight. I always reply with something along the lines of &#39;unless you are injecting steroids into your butt, then no!!&#39; 🤦🏼‍♀️ It takes a lot of time and considerable hard work for females to build muscle, you won&#39;t &#39;look like a man&#39; after lifting one weight!

Especially when you start out and the weights aren't that heavy, you can squat every workout.  Find a good program that focuses on the big barbell movements, and add in some accessories near the end of the workout.  CrossFit is another great place to start<sup><a href=\"#crossfit\">5</a></sup>.  I started out using <a href=\"https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/jason-blaha-ice-cream-fitness-5x5-novice-workout\">Jason Blaha's Ice Cream 5x5 Novice Program</a>.  I'm a pretty strong guy and it worked great for months.  When you get started, make sure to learn proper form and then push the weights - in that order!  Learn the <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/rpe-scale-heart-health\">RPE scale</a> and how to use it - your sets should be in the RPE 6-8 scale for the most part.  Plan on spending 3-5 hours a week at the gym; about 60-90 minutes per workout.  Get plenty of rest too.  It should be hard and you should be sore.</p>\n\n<p>Being sore is undervalued today.  Most people live comfortably and happily without much exertion, ever.  But feeling sore the next day is an incredible reminder that you are alive.  That your body is one hell of a machine, and that it is working for you.  That you are actively not dying today.  You are improving and getting better, that's what being sore should tell you.  It feels <em>GOOD</em> and it's incredibly motivating to do it again, better, the next time.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You are improving and getting better, that's what being sore should tell you.  It feels <em>GOOD</em> and it's incredibly motivating to do it again, better, the next time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And speaking of motivation, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5xXsdWRaFw\">you</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s86DJ1pVF0U\">should</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9ywhy0x7G4\">definitely</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvBgWzzBlR8\">get</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNOMmmf8eWs\">some</a>.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"coaching\">Coaching</h5>\n\n<p>Motivation is huge.  This type of transformation, a real transformation, takes consistency and dedication.  You've got to want it - not in the \"It would be really cool to have abs on the beach one day\" kinda way, but in the \"holy shit I love this and can't wait to get to the gym today and do some work!\" kinda way.  You've got to love the process, not the outcome.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You've got to love the process, not the outcome.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To push yourself and effect change, you've got to be smart about this too.  And that probably means getting a trainer or a coach.  A good one.</p>\n\n<p>A big chunk of personal trainers out there are junk.  The ones at most commercial gyms are junk.  Their purpose is to teach novices how not to get injured<sup><a href=\"#hurt\">6</a></sup> and to inject motivation into the workout.  But look.. if this is going to work, the motivation has to come from you, not from someone else.  It still probably does take someone else to help diagnose your weaknesses, your problems with form, answer questions, and to come up with programming that will push you without overdoing it.</p>\n\n<p>The nice thing these days is that the internet enables you to find someone good wherever you are.  I found <a href=\"http://www.whitneysp.com/\">my coach</a> on Instagram, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ct_whitney/\">he is awesome</a>.  <a href=\"http://www.whitneysp.com/testimonials.html\">He's the kind of coach</a> you should get.  I post videos to track progress and I get suggestions, criticism, and kudos.  I ask questions and get answers the same day, all the time.  And he leads by example, and works as hard or harder himself than all of his clients.  </p>\n\n<p>And that's your motivation.  Find someone better than you and emulate them.  Stop making excuses - and there can be so many made so easily - <br />\n and just start.  Wherever you are, just start. </p>\n\n<h5 id=\"start\">Start</h5>\n\n<p>Starting is simple.  But holy crap is it hard.  That's why we like all of those life-changing yet mendacious fitness headlines.  They feel good.  They feel simple.  They make us feel like less of a failure, even as they set us up to fail again.</p>\n\n<p>And there is some truth in all of them, just like there's a hard but honest truth in the phrase \"morbid obesity\".  We all have choices to make about life and death.  And choosing to make our lives better really is simple.  Eat less, move more.  Lift Weights.  Be sore on a regular basis.  Make small good choices.  Be consistent.  Work hard.  But above all, just start.  And keep going.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"footnotes\">Footnotes</h6>\n\n<p><em>1.</em> <a name=\"friends\"></a>8 or 9 of my friends have done this same diet over the last few months and all of them have had similar success, losing 20-30 lbs.</p>\n\n<p><em>2.</em> <a name=\"math\"></a>You should totally watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIlsN32WaE\">this talk</a> which describes the math and chemistry behind weight loss.  I was amazed to find that, when I burn fat, it exits the body as 80% CO<sub>2</sub> I breathe out and 20% H<sub>2</sub>O I pee out.</p>\n\n<p><em>3.</em> <a name=\"hiit\"></a>You can definitely do cardio for weight loss.  You just shouldn't do it in place of lifting weights.  If you're already lifting 3 or more times a week, then adding <a href=\"http://www.simplyshredded.com/cardio-for-fat-loss-high-intensity-interval-training-cardio-vs-low-intensity-steady-state-cardio.html\">HIIT and LISS</a> into your routine will do amazing things.  HIIT stands for High Intensity Interval Training - 30-60 second sprints with rests in between is one example.  LISS is Low Intensity Steady State cardio - just going for a pleasant morning walk.</p>\n\n<p><em>4.</em> <a name=\"oly\"></a>There's another gym route to take, possibly even better than powerlifting, and that's olympic lifting.  The two main lifts here are the snatch and the clean &amp; jerk.  They require all the same core, leg, and major muscle group strength as powerlifting while adding much more flexibility and balance.  If you're starting from scratch, this may be the best route.</p>\n\n<p><em>5.</em> <a name=\"crossfit\"></a>CrossFit is an awesome way to get started.  Where it fails is by making novices think that a WOD by itself will get them where they want to be.  A lot of people see the CrossFit athletes on TV and think that their 20 minute workout is enough.  It isn't.  You need to spend some more time in the gym to move the needle.</p>\n\n<p><em>6.</em> <a name=\"hurt\"></a>It's pretty important to be able to avoid injury.  As the weights have gotten heavier, I've had to learn how to focus more on mobility and flexibility.  A complete novice probably should have at least some in person training to get the gist of what's going on.  CrossFit gyms can excel here.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2017-05-21T01:39:14.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2017-06-15T02:15:28.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2017-06-15T02:15:00.000Z","published_by":1,"visibility":"public","mobiledoc":null,"amp":null}],"posts_tags":[{"id":1,"post_id":114,"tag_id":2,"sort_order":0}],"roles":[{"id":1,"uuid":"8e7ed316-baf4-484d-9892-6f14e20961de","name":"Administrator","description":"Administrators","created_at":"2014-06-27T17:34:38.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2014-06-27T17:34:38.000Z","updated_by":1},{"id":2,"uuid":"96c8ae2c-a4d8-4e1a-bb9b-107c57f00975","name":"Editor","description":"Editors","created_at":"2014-06-27T17:34:38.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2014-06-27T17:34:38.000Z","updated_by":1},{"id":3,"uuid":"b441dd13-c6a8-42b0-a33a-1160c9db680e","name":"Author","description":"Authors","created_at":"2014-06-27T17:34:38.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2014-06-27T17:34:38.000Z","updated_by":1},{"id":4,"uuid":"720f5cb2-4520-4618-a0f3-4464fba4b862","name":"Owner","description":"Blog
